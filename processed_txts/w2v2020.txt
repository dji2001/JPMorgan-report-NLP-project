 business roundtable’s statement on the purpose of a corporation in august  business roundtable released the below statement on the purpose of a corporation signed by  ceos including jamie dimon then chair of the associationthis statement repositioned the definition of corporate success as serving shareholders principally to endorsing a modern standard of corporate responsibility to serve all stakeholders — customers employees suppliers communities and shareholdersamericans deserve an economy that allows each person to succeed through hard work and creativity and to lead a life of meaning and dignitywe believe the freemarket system is the best means of generating good jobs a strong and sustainable economy innovation a healthy environment and economic opportunity for allbusinesses play a vital role in the economy by creating jobs fostering innovation and providing essential goods and servicesbusinesses make and sell consumer products manufacture equipment and vehicles support the national defense grow and produce food provide health care generate and deliver energy and offer financial communications and other services that underpin economic growthwhile each of our individual companies serves its own corporate purpose we share a fundamental commitment to all of our stakeholderswe commit to • delivering value to our customerswe will further the tradition of american companies leading the way in meeting or exceeding customer expectations • investing in our employeesthis starts with compensating them fairly and providing important benefitsit also includes supporting them through training and education that help develop new skills for a rapidly changing worldwe foster diversity and inclusion dignity and respect • dealing fairly and ethically with our supplierswe are dedicated to serving as good partners to the other companies large and small that help us meet our missions • supporting the communities in which we workwe respect the people in our communities and protect the environment by embracing sustainable practices across our businesses • generating longterm value for shareholders who provide the capital that allows companies to invest grow and innovatewe are committed to transparency and effective engagement with shareholderseach of our stakeholders is essentialwe commit to deliver value to all of them for the future success of our companies our communities and our countryreleased august    ithe corporate citizen the purpose of a corporation we need to build and maintain a healthy and vibrant company over the long run to be able to deal with the uncertainties of life to invest to innovate and to growto be healthy and vibrant a company must do many things well it must do a great job for customers attract develop and retain talented employees and serve its communitiesit is vital that we do all of these things as the failure to perform any one of them with excellence could lead to the failure of allover the years we have extensively described the efforts we make to take care of our customers and our employeesthe purpose of this section is to describe our corporate responsibility efforts in more detail and explain their importanceto be healthy and vibrant – and to create long term shareholder value – a company must be financially successful over the long runthe problem with the american public’s impression of “shareholder value” is that too many people interpret it to mean shortterm rapacious profit taking – which ironically is the last thing that leads to building real longterm shareholder valueand when they hear the word “fiduciary” they think we are standing behind our lawyersobviously companies have fiduciary respon sibilitieshowever legal and fiduciary language does not represent how most ceos and boards actually run their companieswe should not be buttonholed by the debate about whether there are “fiduciary” reasons to think of “shareholder value” narrowly and to the exclusion of those who work at the company our clients and communi tieswhen most ceos and board members wake up each morning they worry about all of the things that they need to do right to build a successful companya company is like a teamwe must do many things well to succeed and ultimately that leads to creating shareholder valuebusinesses must earn the trust of their customers and communities by acting ethically and morallyto a good company its reputation is every thingthat reputation is earned day in and day out with every interaction with customers and communitiesthis is not to say that companies and people do not make mistakes – of course they dooften a reputation is earned by how you deal with those mistakeswhile all businesses are different there are some fundamentals good products fair and transparent pricing thoughtful and respon sive service and continuous innovationgreat companies constantly set high stan dards acknowledge their mistakes and prop erly discipline or dismiss bad actorsgreat companies are strict about having fair dealings with their customersi have always loved that home depot’s company policy is not to raise lumber prices in the imme diate aftermath of a hurricane regardless of whether it can i want to remind readers that banks essentially did not raise the price of credit when they renewed loans during the financial crisis pricing to customers should be what’s fair – not what a company can get away withbanks in particular have to be rigorous about standardsunlike many companies that will simply sell you a product if you can pay for it banks must necessarily turn  ithe corporate citizen the purpose of a corporation customers down or enforce rules that a customer may not like for example cove nantsthis makes open and transparent dealings even more importantwhen i hear examples of people doing something that is wrong because they could be paid more it makes my blood boil – and i don’t want them working hereand i can’t believe it when i hear about a company or a hedge fund causing loans and a company to default so they can trigger credit default swap hedges – it’s completely unethicalwe must always strive particularly in tough times to earn the trust of our customers and communitiesif you live in a small town and run a corner bakery it is very easy to understand the value of being a responsible community citizenmost businesses on “main street” keep the sidewalk in front of their store clean so people don’t slip and fallthey often participate in the community by supporting local sports teams or religious institutionsa bakery or a restaurant will often donate surplus food at the end of the day to a local homeless sheltermost businesses under stand that everyone doing their part to make the community a better place is both the moral thing to do and a driver of better commercial outcomes for the townwhen jpmorganchase enters a community we take great pride in being a responsible citizen at the local level – just like the local bakerywe lend to and support local busi nesseswe help customers with banking lending and savingand our local corpo rate responsibility efforts and philanthropic programs examples of which are described in the following features in this section help make these communities strongerbeing a responsible community citizen locally is critical and it is easy to understand whybeing a responsible community citizen nationally or globally is more critical and more complexmost people consider corporate responsi bility to be merely enhanced philanthropythis is understandablebut it is far harder to understand what being a responsible community citizen means in terms of macro corporate responsibilitywhile we are devoted to philanthropy – we spend  million a year on these efforts – corporate responsibility is far more than thatjpmorganchase takes an active role in largescale public policy issueswe are fully engaged in trying to solve some of the world’s biggest issues – climate change poverty economic development and racial inequality – and the accompanying features that follow describe the extensive efforts we are makingwith welldesigned policies we think these problems can all be solvedin the last section of this letter i detail certain policy issues which – if forcefully and effectively addressed – would be great for america and the world at largewe engage at this level because companies like ours have an extraordinary capability to helpwe help not just with funding but with devel oping strong public policy which can have a greater impact on society than the collec tive effect of companies that are respon sible community citizens locallythis year for example our policycenter published research based on the actual experiences of our customers and communities showing how new policies could drive a more inclu sive economic recovery and help small businessesjpmorganchase has always recognized that longterm business success depends on community success and that is  ithe corporate citizen the purpose of a corporation one of the reasons for our enduring achieve mentwhen everyone has a fair shot at participating – and sharing – in the rewards of growth the economy will be stronger and our society will be betterwe also believe that businesses’ extraordi nary capabilities are even more powerful when put to use in collaboration with governments’ capabilities particularly when seeking to solve our biggest economic and societal ills at the local levelas washington dc and central governments around the world struggle with partisan gridlock and an inability to get big things done local communities are coming up with some of the best ideas to make civic society work for more peoplemayors governors educators major employers entrepreneurs community leaders and nonprofits are making serious progress developing innovative approaches that address our greatest challenges but their work often flies under the radarwe must elevate these thoughtful ideas and find ways to share them with others facing similar situ ations enabling more communities to benefit from proven localized solutions after busi nesses have had success with some of these efforts locally they can be adopted across the country and in fact around the worldour effort is substantial and permanent and has support throughout the companyimportantly these civic efforts are supported by senior leadership and are managed by some of our best people these initiatives are not an afterthought and are sustainablefor our part we are making significant long term datadriven

efforts climate change is a critical issue of our timereducing greenhouse gas ghg emissions — the main cause of climate change — requires collective ambition and cooperation across the public and private sectorscoal oil and natural gas — the primary sources of ghg emissions — have powered the world’s energy economy for many decades advancing significant economic growth and social development for billions around the worldbut our reliance on these resources now threatens the very growth they have enabledthe challenge we face is significantwhile continuing to generate power for all of our needs big and small — lighting and heating our homes commuting to work and charging our phones and computers as well as operating manufacturing facilities that produce goods used around the world each day — we also need to bring energy to the nearly  million people who still don’t have reliable access to electricityand we need to find a way to do all of these things while setting a path for achieving netzero emissions bythe fact is we’re long past debating whether climate change is realbut we need to acknowledge that the solution is not as simple as walking away from fossil fuelswe will need resources such as oil and natural gas until commercial affordable and lowcarbon alternatives can be developed to meet all of our global energy needsthis is where business and government leaders need to focus their time and attentionwhile wind and solar technologies have made huge strides they’re principally deployed for electricity generationwe don’t have clean alternatives for industrial and manufacturing energy needs for examplenor do we yet have solutions for heavy transportation such as trucking and air travelwhat’s more the projected growth of technologies like electric vehicles is going to place huge pressures on the need for rare earth minerals — which also presents geopolitical and environmental challengespolicymakers have taken some important stepsthe paris agreement is one such success but we must put a price on carbona carbon tax with a commensurate carbon dividend — directly returned to the people is an excellent way to dramatically reduce carbon while investing in communities most adversely affected by this muchneeded transitionwithout a benchmark like this businesses and economies won’t be able to properly factor the cost of carbon and the benefit of alternatives into their longterm strategic planning and capital investment decisionscompanies are figuring out how to manage amid these challengesand many are also dealing with a growing chorus of pressure from customers regulators shareholders and activists with strong perspectives on how corporations and other institutions should address climate changewhen we cut through all the noise here’s what we know to be true traditional energy resources play an essential role in our global economy todaywe can agree on the need to make our energy system much less carbon intensivebut abandoning companies that produce and consume these fuels is not a solutionfurthermore it’s economically counterproductiveinstead we must work with themthere’s huge opportunity in sustainable and lowcarbon technologies and businesseswhile many of these technologies and companies are mature many more are just getting started — and more will need to be created in the coming decadesin addition all companies will need capital and advice to help them innovate evolve and become more efficient while staying competitive in a changing worldthis is why we made a commitment in  to align our financing activities in three carbon intensive sectors — oil and gas electric power and automotive manufacturing — with the paris agreementto do so we will measure our clients’ carbon performance against sectorbased ghg reduction targets that we’re setting for  — with the goal of helping them reduce emissions from their direct operations and in the case of oil and gas and automotive companies reduce ghgs from the use of their products  the key metric we plan to use for evaluating climate performance is carbon intensity which is a measure of ghg emissions per unit of outputusing intensity will enable us to evaluate the relative efficiency of companies and to adjust for factors such as size clearly showing which are performing the best or getting betterwe also want to take advantage of the huge opportunity to support existing and new green companies and to help others lower their carbon footprint — all while advancing economic development and standards of living for people around the worldthis includes helping our clients invest in significant and continuous performance improvements new technologies alternative energy solutions and research and development rdthrough our recently launched center for carbon transition clients will have access to information resources as well as advisory and financing solutions that will help them evolve in a changing worldwe’re also working to make our own company as sustainable as possiblewe’ve committed to becoming carbon neutral for the emissions generated to power our buildings branches and data centers as well as those related to employee travela big focus of our strategy is to generate our own power using solarcurrently we have plans to install  megawatts of solar capacity across our corporate office buildings in the united states and the united kingdomthis includes a megawatt rooftop and carport solar installation at our corporate campus in columbus ohio which will produce about  of its power needswe’re also installing  megawatts of solar capacity at  retail branch locations across the united states which will provide approximately  of each branch’s power needswe have an opportunity to make the world a better place

guessworktest test test and learn learn learnand accept failure as a “normal” recurring iilessons from leadership outcomedevelop great models but under stand they are not the answer – judgment has to be involved in matters related to human beings and extraordinary eventsyou need to have good decisionmaking processesforce urgency and kill compla cencyknow that there is competition everywhere all the timebut even if you do all of this well it is not enoughenforce a good decisionmaking processa good decisionmaking process involves having the right people in the room with all information fully shared all too often i have seen precisely the oppositethere is also the need for constant feedback and followupa bad decisionmaking process killsif neces sary review the information over and over – often the answer is simply waiting to be found – and if you don’t have to don’t rushwhile intuition matters and it can be the final deciding factor intuition is not guessing – it is usually based on years of experience hard work and practiceexamine raw data and focus on real numbersit is helpful to try to separate and examine actual raw data versus calculated numbersa few examples will suffice you always learn a lot more when you dig deep into the numberslook at total car sales the number of people employed or the actual price of goods compared with calculated data like gross domestic product gdp inflation or productivityfor the latter examine all of the methodologies and assumptions that go into those calculationsfor instance productivity tries to adjust for or simply sometimes can’t adjust for new products that are superior to old products such as smartphones versus dumb phones similarly calculations for inflation factor in something called “owners’ equivalent rent” which generally differs substantially from actual home prices or rental costsapplied to corporate operations examine the detailsmany companies look at “net new accounts” which could be going up dramatically because of prices or marketing – masking attrition or consumers’ dissatis faction with the productin detail look at errors complaints attrition competitors and other new entrantslook at market share by customer segment so as not to miss behavior shiftsfrequently raw data tell a different story from what management may be saying too often management teams use the facts to justify what they already think or to celebrate what they believe is a great successbeing true to these principles requires relentless discipline – which you should expect of us  iilessons from leadershipbefore conducting an important analysis assess all relevant factors involvedi frequently see people trying to understand a complex situation without considering all the factors involvedin the final section i attempt to analyze china as a strategic competitorit’s critical to weigh all the factors cultural psychological and historicalalso what are the legal factors and how is the rule of law applied what is the coun try’s situation with raw materials what is the country’s geography and relationship with its neighbors it is important to lay out all the important variables before you start an assessment to ensure that they are all carefully reviewed and that one’s judgment is not clouded early on by overfocusing on just a few issuesin business this type of assessment should also be applied to your competitors and to those you deem to be future competitors as well as to your own strengths and weak nessesin the next section i describe the evolving competitive landscape for bankswhile i am fanatical about detail and multi year analysis it’s important to be cautious about its applicationassumptions are frequently involved and small changes in a few variables can dramatically change an outcomeeven net present value analysis fails to capture the true value of something after a certain period of timefor instance people commonly look at the fiveyear net present value of a customer acquisition which can mask the true compounding effect of keeping that client for  yearsand we have often seen net present value analysis fail to capture ancillary benefits like customer happiness that can often be more important than the analysis itselfsometimes a new product or an investment should simply be considered table stakes – meaning there’s no need to do analysis at allthink about banks adding the capa bility of opening new accounts digitally for example or maintaining a strong technology infrastructure and adopting new technolo gies like cloud or artificial intelligence aithese could be lifeordeath decisions for a company so instead of focusing on net present value the emphasis should be on getting the work done properly efficiently and quicklybureaucrats can torture people with analysis stifling innovation new products testing and intuitionin the last section i go into further detail about how certain analyses fail to guide us to the right answer in public policy – particularly around complex issues like healthcare job creation mortgage markets and infrastructureunderstand when analysis is necessary and when it impedes change  iilessons from leadershipalways deal with realityin business as in life we must deal with both certainty and uncertaintya simple look at history and our economic past illustrates the rather unpredictable nature of thingsas a result at the firm we try to look at all the possibilities as well as their probabili tiesfor example we conduct well over  stress tests each week to make sure we are prepared for what we are not predictingwe even evaluate the laws and regulations we live under today and project how they might be interpreted  years from now – we call this “reinterpretation risk” we look at a broad range of possibilities and probabil ities to ensure that we understand as best as we can all of the possible outcomes – recognizing that we are not trying to make a forecast with certaintysometimes the action you take may not be the one that gives you the best outcome but the one that gives you a good outcome and reduces the possibilities of bad outcomesit also is often very difficult to capture the inflection points in the economymost people imagine the future as being roughly equiva lent to the past give or take a bithowever we know there are significant inflection points which are sometimes easy to see in hindsight but almost impossible to predictwhile we also try to keep things as stream lined as possible making things simpler than they really are is equally flawedtoo many times people seek simple cookiecutter solu tions that sound good but just don’t workfor example class size in schools matters but not necessarily in all types of classesin vietnam when a major city once had a rat population problem the government devised what it thought was an easy foolproof solu tion pay people to kill ratsall people had to do was bring in a rat tail to be paidwhat the government didn’t consider was that people would breed rats for a supply of rat tails to sell all compensation schemes should be continuously reevaluated  iilessons from leadershipremain open to learning how to become a better leaderin addition to the above thoughts on anal ysis assessment and good decision making some softer leadership lessons are equally importantas companies get bigger and more complex leaders need to be more like coaches and conductors than playersif ceos are running a smaller business they can literally be involved in virtually everything and make most of the decisions – they often rely on traditional commandandcontrol tacticsthis approach does not work as companies get bigger – the ceos simply cannot be involved in every major decisioncommand and constant feedback may be better than command and controlhere is where leaders would be better off providing clear direction and letting people do their job including making mistakes along the waysoft power – essentially trust and maturity – may become more important than hard powersoft power creates respect among team members with the coach offering honest assessment and support while allowing flexibilityhere the boss makes fewer but tougher decisions such as removing people – when it must be done – and even then it is handled respectfullypeople will give to the best of their ability for leaders they respect and who they know are trying to help them succeedrespect and learn from your peoplemanagers and leaders get spread pretty thinwhile they should have a wide grasp of many subjects they could not possibly know everything their people knowleaders should continually be learning from their peoplethey should go to a sales conference and ask lots of questions of their salespeoplegather technology people in the room with branch managers and ask “how are things working” taking a road trip should not be only for the purpose of showing the flag but also for learning from your employees and customershave curiosityit’s important to ask questions to try to understand varying points of viewbe willing to change your mindread every thingdon’t defend decisions of the pastleaders should be happy when their people prove them wrongdo not have a rigid mindsetand do not be complacentskip hierarchyif everything in a large orga nization must go up and down the hierar chical ladder bureaucratic arteriosclerosis along with cya sets in and that company’s life expectancy is substantially shortenedit should be routine that data memos and ideas are shared – skipping hierarchies – and aren’t vetted by all in the chain of commandthis makes people more responsible for what they are doing improves the dissem ination of new information and new ideas and speeds things up overallin addition it’s good to have a few mavericks who are not afraid to shake things upthe ones who challenge authority or convention often get far more done than the ones who go along to get alongcollaboration is wonderful but it can be overdoneact at the speed of relevancewhen leaders have plenty of time to make decisions they should analyze all factors over and over – take the necessary time as choices can be hard to reverseand there are other deci sions that are more like “battlefield promo tions” where there’s no luxury of time and in fact going slow may make things much worsei’ve also seen people take a tremen dous amount of time to make an unim portant decision which just wastes time and slows things downin business some decisions should be made carefully – for instance putting the right people in the right jobbut others such as making pricing decisions dealing with customer problems and handling reputa tional issues must be done quickly for these problems do not age well  the importance of developing leaders earlier in this section i mentioned that my number one priority is to put a healthy and productive succession process in placeas i will be increasingly focused on this process i would like to share my thoughts about the essential qualities a leader must have particularly as they relate to a large multinational corporation like jpmorganchaseleadership is an honor a privilege and a deep obligationwhen leaders make mistakes a lot of people can get hurtbeing true to oneself and avoiding selfdeception are as important to a leader as having people to turn to for thoughtful unbiased advicei believe social intelligence and “emotional quotient” or eq matter in managementeq can include empathy clarity of thought compassion and strength of charactergood people want to work for good leadersbad leaders can drive out almost anyone who’s good because they are corrosive to an organization and since many are manipulative and deceptive it often is a challenge to find them and root them outat many of the best companies throughout history the constant creation of good leaders is what has enabled the organizations to stand the true test of greatness — the test of timebelow are some essential hallmarks of a good leaderwhile we cannot be great at all of these traits — i know i’m not — to be successful a leader needs to get most of them rightdiscipline this means holding regular business reviews talent reviews and team meetings and constantly striving for improvement — from having a strong work ethic to making lists and doing real detailed followupleadership is like exercise the effect has to be sustained for it to do any goodfortitude this attribute often is missing in leaders they need to have a fierce resolve to actit means driving change fighting bureaucracy and politics and taking ownership and responsibilityhigh standards leaders must set high standards of performance all the time at a detailed level and with a real sense of urgencyleaders must compare themselves with the besthuge institutions have a tendency toward slowing things down which demands that leaders push forward constantlytrue leaders must set the highest standards of integrity — those standards are not embedded in the business but require conscious choicessuch standards demand that we treat customers and employees the way we would want to be treated ourselves or the way we would want our own mother to be treatedability to face facts in a coldblooded honest way leaders emphasize the negatives at management meetings and focus on what can be improved of course it’s okay to celebrate the successes tooall reporting must be accurate and all relevant facts must be reported with full disclosure and on one set of booksopenness sharing information all the time is vital — we should debate the issues and alternative approaches not the factsthe best leaders kill bureaucracy — it can cripple an organization — and watch for signs of politics like sidebar meetings after the real meeting because people wouldn’t speak their mind at the right timeequally important leaders get out in the field regularly so as not to lose touchanyone in a meeting should feel free to speak his or her mind without fear of offending anyone elsei once heard someone describe the importance of having “at least one truthteller at the table” well if there is just one truthteller at the table you’re in trouble — everyone should be a truthtellerreprinted from my  letter to shareholders  setup for success an effective leader makes sure all the right people are in the room — from legal systems and operations to human resources finance and riskit’s also necessary to set up the right structurewhen triheads report to coheads all decisions become political — a setup for failure not successmoralebuilding high morale is developed through fixing problems dealing directly and honestly with issues earning respect and winningit does not come from overpaying people or delivering sweet talk which permits the avoidance of hard decision making and fosters passiveaggressive behaviorsloyalty meritocracy and teamwork while i deeply believe in loyalty it often is misusedloyalty should be to the principles for which someone stands and to the institution loyalty to an individual frequently is another form of cronyismleaders demand a lot from their employees and should be loyal to them — but loyalty and mutual respect are twoway streetsloyalty to employees does not mean that a manager owes them a particular jobloyalty to employees means building a healthy vibrant company telling them the truth and giving them meaningful work training and opportunitiesif employees fall down we should get them the help they needmeritocracy and teamwork also are critical but frequently misunderstoodmeritocracy means putting the best person in the job which promotes a sense of justice in the organization rather than the appearance of cynicism “here they go again taking care of their friends” finally while teamwork is important and often code for “getting along” equally important is an individual’s ability to have the courage to stand alone and do the right thingfair treatment the best leaders treat all people properly and respectfully from clerks to ceoseveryone needs to help everyone else at the company because everyone’s collective purpose is to serve clientswhen strong leaders consider promoting people they pick those who are respected and ask themselves would i want to work for him would i want my kid to report to her humility leaders need to acknowledge those who came before them and helped shape the enterprise — it’s not all their own doingthere’s a lot of luck involved in anyone’s success and a little humility is importantthe overall goal must be to help build a great company — then we can do more for our employees our customers and our communities  to fairly assess the competitive landscape for banks you must fairly evaluate their strengths and weaknesses to deal with both the current competition and evolving compe titionbanks have significant strengths – brand economies of scale profitability and deep roots with their customers and within their communitiesmany companies including banks have flaws of their own making – usually due to bureaucracy compla cency and lack of a deep competitive spiritbanks have other weaknesses born somewhat out of their success – for example inflexible “legacy systems” that need to be moved to the cloud if they are to remain competitivebanks are also required to deal with extensive regu lations which can hinder new competition andor create an opening for both existing and evolving competitorsbanks fiercely compete with each other and now face fierce competi tion from multiple vectorsbanks already compete against a large and powerful shadow banking systemand they are facing extensive competition from silicon valley both in the form of fintechs and big tech companies amazon apple facebook google and now walmart that is here to stayas the importance of cloud ai and digital platforms grows this competi tion will become even more formidableas a result banks are playing an increasingly smaller role in the financial systemi am completely in favor of open compe tition and much of the competition that i cover in this section will be good for americaone of the necessities for a healthy economy and one at the core of america’s success is a strong vibrant financial systemthe disciplined allocation of capital and the constant search for new opportunities

regulators need to understand that maintaining the vibrancy safety and soundness of this system is critical – and this includes maintaining a relatively fair and balanced playing fieldwhile i am still

that us banks and european banks have become much smaller in size relative to multiple measures ranging from shadow banks to fintech competi tors and to markets in generalwhether you look at the chart

every anglethe growth in shadow and fintech banking calls for level playing field regulationthe chart below shows the potential regula tory differences between being a bank and being a nonbank or a fintech company – though this varies for each type of company on each item depending upon its legal and regulatory statusin some cases these regula tory differences may be completely appro priate but certainly not in all caseswhen i make a list like this i know i will be accused of complaining about bank regula tionsbut i am simply laying out the facts for our shareholders in trying to assess the competitive landscape going forwardit is completely clear that increasingly many banking products such as payments and certain forms of deposits among others are moving out of the banking systemin addition lending in many forms – including mortgage student leveraged consumer and noncredit card consumer – is moving out of the banking systemneobanks and nonbanks are gaining share in consumer accounts which effectively hold cashlike depositspayments are also moving out of the banking system in merchant processing and in debit or alternative payment systemswe believe that many of these new compet itors have done a terrific job in easing customers’ pain points and making digital platforms extremely simple to usebut growth in shadow banking has also partially been made possible because rules and regulations imposed upon banks are not necessarily imposed upon these nonbankswhile some of this may have been deliberate sometimes the rules were accidentally calibrated to move risk in an unintended waywe should remember that the quantum of risk may not have changed – it just got moved to a lessregu lated environmentand new risks get createdwhile it is not clear that the rise in nonbanks and shadow banking has reached the point of systemic risk this trend is accelerating and needs to be assiduously monitored which we do regularly as part of our own business  r footnotes adjus

comprehensive capital analysis and review  iiibanks’ enormous competitive threats — from virtually every angle a few items need further explanationon capital requirements you should always remember that the market determines this level not regulators and to the extent that capital requirements in one entity are much higher than another activities will moveironically because standardized capital and gsifi capital do not recognize credit risk banks have a peculiar incentive to hold higher risk credit rather than lower risk creditall companies have operational risk and most companies absorb operating losses through earningsbanks are required to hold substantial capital against this risk i’m not debating that there is operational risk and because of the durbin amendment if a bank has a customer with a small checking account who spends  a year on a debit card the bank will only receive  in debit revenue – while a small bank or nonbank would receivethis differ ence may determine whether you can even compete in certain customer segmentsit’s important to note that while some of the fintechs have done an excellent job they may actually be more expensive to the customerfinally it’s important to point out that not only has private credit been moving to the private markets but so have companies them selvesthe number of public companies in the united states has been dropping dramat ically over the past two decades which has corresponded to an even larger increase in the number of private companiesfollowing its peak at  in  the number of public companies is now around  and if you exclude nonoperating companies such as investment funds and trust compa nies the decline is even more dramaticthis is worthy of serious studythe reasons are complex and may include factors such as onerous reporting requirements higher litigation expenses annual shareholder meetings focused on matters that most share holders view as frivolous or inappropriate for company actions costly regulations less compensation flexibility and heightened public scrutinyit’s incumbent upon us to figure out why so many companies and so much capital are being moved out of the transparent public markets to the less trans parent private markets and whether this is in the country’s longterm interestwe need competition – because it makes banking better – and we need to manage the emerging risks with level playing field regulation in a way that ensures safety and soundness across the industryai the cloud and digital are transforming how we do businesswe cannot overemphasize the extraordinary importance of new technology in the new worldtoday all technology is built “cloud enabled” which means the applications and their associated data can run on the cloudthis brings many extraordinary advantages but the one that i’d like to spotlight is the immediate ability to access data and associ ated machine learning with virtually unlim ited compute poweressentially in the cloud you can “access” hundreds of databases and deploy machine learning in a split second – something mainframes and legacy systems and databases simply cannot doto go from the legacy world to the cloud applications not only have to be “refactored” but more important data also must be “replatformed” so it is accessiblethis availability of data – and banks have a tremendous amount of data – makes data enormously valuable and digitally accessibleall of this work takes time and money but it’s absolutely essential that we do itwe already extensively use ai quite success fully in fraud and risk marketing pros pecting idea generation operations trading and in other areas – to great effect but we are still at the beginning of this journeyand we are training our people in machine learning – there simply is no speed fast enough  iiibanks’ enormous competitive threats — from virtually every anglefintech and big tech are here … big time fintech companies here and around the world are making great strides in building both digital and physical banking products and servicesfrom loans to payment systems to investing they have done a great job in developing easytouse intuitive fast and smart productswe have spoken about this for years but this competition now is every wherefintech’s ability to merge social media use data smartly and integrate with other platforms rapidly often without the disadvan tages of being an actual bank will help these companies win significant market shareimportantly big tech amazon apple face book google – and as i said now i’d include walmart is here tootheir strengths are extraordinary with ubiquitous platforms and endless dataat a minimum they will all embed payments systems within their ecosystems and create a marketplace of bank products and servicessome may create exclusive white label banking relationships and it is possible some will use various banking licenses to do it directlythough their strengths may be substantial big tech companies do have some issues to deal with that may in fact slow them downtheir regulatory environment globally is heating up and they will have to confront major issues in the future banks have faced similar scrutinyissues include data privacy and use how taxes are paid on digital products and antitrust and anticompetitive issues – such as favoring their own products and services over others on their platform and how they price products and access to their platformsin addition big tech will have very strong competition – not just from jpmorganchase in banking but also from each otherand that competition is far bigger than just banking – big tech companies now compete with each other in advertising commerce search and socialjpmorganchase is aggressively adapting to new challengesas tough as the competition will be jpmorganchase is wellpositioned for the challengebut our eyes are wide open as the landscape changes rapidly and dramat icallywe have an extraordinary number of products and services a large existing client base huge economies of scale a fortress balance sheet and a great trusted brandwe also have an extraordinary amount of data and we need to adopt ai and cloud as fast as possible so we can make better use of it to better serve our customerswe need to make our extraordinary number of products and services a huge plus by improving ease of use and reducing complexitywe need to move faster and bolder in how we attack new markets while protecting our existing onessometimes new markets look too small or appear not to be critical to our customer base – until they arewe intend to be a little more aggressive herewhile we will argue for a level playing field both in terms of how products and services are treated by regulators and possibly how competition should be treated across plat forms we are not relying on much to changeso we will simply have to contend with the hand we are dealt and adjust our strategies as appropriatewe have mentioned that our highest and best use of capital is to expand our busi nesses and we would prefer to make great acquisitions instead of buying back stockwe are somewhat constrained by how much we can grow our balance sheet because our capital charges will grow with our size so sometimes buying back stock may still be the best optionbut acquisitions are in our future and fintech is an area where some of that cash could be put to work – this could include payments asset management data and relevant products and serviceswe will continue to do everything in our power to make jpmorganchase successful – and are confident we can do so  we cannot overemphasize the importance of cyber risk not just to our bank we spend more than  million a year on cybersecurity but also to our customers countries economies and critical industries ie telecom and powerwe have pointed out to our shareholders before that having disciplined cyber hygiene is almost as important as the money you spendthreats to our cybersecurity need urgent attention from our government as issues of national security and impediments to tradegovern ments should build on prior agreements in the united nations recognizing the appli cability of international law to cyberspace and enforcing obligations to hold bad actors accountableacknowledging that govern ments and their regulatory agencies are prime targets for cyber criminals these agencies need to provide transparency to those affected by incidents eg financial institutions and others that hold sensitive data invest in the uplift to cybersecurity and adopt safe and sound practices for data protection and handlingmuch of our extraordinary cyber capabil ities are also used to train and protect our customers particularly in the areas of risk and fraudin this section i review and analyze some of the current critical issues that affect our companycyber risk remains a significant threativspecific issues facing our companybrexit was finally accomplished — but uncertainties lingerbrexit was accomplished but many issues still need to be negotiatedand in those negotiations europe has had and will continue to have the upper handin the short run ie the next few years this cannot possibly be a positive for the united kingdom’s gdp – the effect after that will be completely based upon whether the united kingdom has a comprehensive and well executed strategic plan that is acceptable to europeincluded among the unresolved questions is how financial services will operatelondon has been a major financial center that under all laws and regulations could conduct business throughout europefor most of us the bulk of our operations ie risk compliance audit legal regula tory marketmaking investment banking research and asset management were performed centrally in londonit was hugely efficient for all of europe – and for finan cial services companies as welllondon is a magnificent place to do business in terms of the rule of law human capital tech nology transportation language and many other facetsbut future financial regulations were left uncertain in brexit and it is clear that over time european politicians and regulators will make many understandable demands to move functions into european jurisdictionsbecause of this – and because of strong european efforts to compete with london – paris frankfurt dublin and amsterdam will grow in importance as more financial functions are performed thereeven so few winners are likely to emerge from this fragmentationduring this transition our costs most of which will probably be passed on to customers in one form or another will go up as functions become duplicatedwe may reach a tipping point many years out when it may make sense to move all functions that service europe out of the united kingdom and into continental europebut london still has the opportunity to adapt and reinvent itself particularly as the digital landscape continues to revolutionize financial servicesinnovation is key to preparing for doing the business of tomorrow versus relying on the shifting ways of the past  ivspecific issues facing our companynew accounting requirements affect reserve reporting but not how we run our businessa new loan loss reserving method called the current expected credit losses cecl standard was adopted by large financial institutions effective januaryto oversimplify there were two main changesfirst you must reserve for expected credit losses over the full remaining expected life of the loan whereas in the past we reserved for losses that had already been incurred using a forecast over a loss emergence period for example the ensuing  months or so for credit cardssecond you were to incorporate different reasonable and supportable macro economic forecasts for multiple scenarios in estimating lossesgiven the benign macro economic environment when this new cecl standard was adopted it increased reserves by only  billion which was primarily attributed to moving to lifetime loss coverage for card with only a small amount of reserves for the probability of a far worse economic environmenthundreds of variables go into the scenarios and calculations shown in the chart belowduring periods of stress the firm leaned more heavily to the downside to reflect uncertainties not fully captured by the scenarios themselvesuncertainties included a substantial drop in headline employment without corresponding job creation the degree of permanent job losses the extent and timing of federal government assis tance unknowns around vaccine efficacy against new virus strains and the poten tial for economic scarring from changes in consumer behavior and the recovery of directly impacted sectors  r

jdallowancerangeofdownside  ivspecific issues facing our company the best way to look at this is to analyze our loan loss reserves as of decemberour central case is essentially our baseline forecast and is roughly similar to the federal reserve’s current forecast at the time which would have unemployment over the ensuing  months atif we reserved to this case our reserves would total  billionbut we run multiple scenarios – one of which is an extreme adverse casethis worst case which is slightly more severe than the federal reserve’s extreme adverse case would have unemployment over the ensuing  months at  among other variablesif we reserved as if this scenario had a  chance of happening we would require  billion in reservesafter proba bility weighting multiple scenarios we ended the year with  billion in reservesclearly in turbulent times these scenarios and the probabilities assigned to them are highly uncertain and volatilethe following are also clear and extremely important the firm earns almost  billion  pre provision profit annually it is able to easily handle large increases in reserves and we could easily have done substantially more while maintaining high capital and high liquiditythis is also why we saw no reason to cut our dividendif however the worst case scenario had happened which means it could have gotten even worse from there we might have cut our dividend to retain capital out of prudenceimportantly cecl does not change risk management or the way we run the companywe have been lending and will continue to lend to our clients and customers throughout the pandemic with prudent risk managementour credit risk decisions and broader risk appetite are mostly driven by our clients’ needs and market conditions rather than solely by reserve methodologywhile reserve levels are an estimate reflecting management’s expectations of credit losses at the balance sheet date they may not reflect the amount of losses ultimately realizedwhile we disbanded haven we will continue to build on what we learnedalthough the united states has some of the best healthcare in the world ie doctors pharmaceutical care and innovation and many people from

without justification by better outcomesthere is no transparency in pricing with patients legitimately complaining of hidden costsand chronic care is not necessarily managed properlymore than  million americans are uninsured and we are falling short in basic wellnessamazon berkshire hathaway and jpmorganchase set up haven to address some of these problems and in the process we learned a lot about how the healthcare system could be improvedalthough we decided to disband haven jpmorganchase will continue to build on what we learnedwe will invest in healthcare innovation and other approaches to improve the health and wellbeing of our employees and address this critical national issuemore details will be shared as we progress  within days of realizing that covid was a global pandemic that would virtually close down large parts of the world’s economies the us government moved with unprece dented speedfortunately banks were part of the solution – unlike in the great recessionand unlike the great recession the us economy was actually in good shape going into the covid recessionthough there are many differences it’s instructive to compare the recovery from the great recession with the expected recovery from the covid recessionbold action by the fed and the us government effectively reversed financial panicthe federal reserve critically with the support of the ustreasury immediately rolled out facilities that financed treasuries corporate bonds mortgagebacked secu rities and other securities that effectively reversed the financial panic taking placea fullblown financial crisis would have made the covid recession far worse deeper and longermarkets reacted extremely posi tively and companies over the next nine months raised an unprecedented  trillion in debt and equity at good prices dramati cally improving their financial condition and balance sheetscongress importantly also took immediate action to provide fiscal stimulus the corona virus aid relief and economic security act also known as the cares act totaling  trillionthis largely consisted of stimulus payments to individuals enhanced unem ployment insurance and loans which could be forgiven to small businessesplease see the sidebar on page  for more detail on the paycheck protection programsuffice it to say while real damage was done the size and scope of these programs dramatically reversed the deterioration of the economy and unemployment which hit  in april  but made steady prog ress back to  by the end of the year – though this number underrepresents the damage that was done because of the large deterioration in labor force participation and the potential permanent loss of many small businessesone last important point the speed and breadth of the programs were critical and there is no way they could have been done perfectlywhile it always makes sense to do a thorough postmortem review and to prop erly punish those who deliberately misuse emergency government programs we should

business administration would fully forgive the loannot surprisingly there were bumps in the road as the sba and lenders worked around the clock to establish and implement specific rules and processes as well as develop the technology to support the programultimately though it was a lifesaver for millions of us businessesin business banking we processed more than four years’ worth of loan applications in  days — a combination of digital prowess and the efforts of more than  people who manually reviewed applications and contacted clients after hours and on weekends to correct errorsall

confusing interplay of monetary fiscal and regulatory policy continues through recessionsprior to the great recession in  banks operated under a completely different regu latory capital and liquidity regimebanks held less capital for many banks it was too little they left virtually no money deposited at the fed they generally lent out an amount roughly equal to their deposits and they had less liquidity mostly in the form of trea suries and mortgages the securities portfolio was also used for interest rate exposurethis completely changed with doddfrank the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act capitalliquidity rules in  and it changed again dramati cally with the covid recession ofthe quantitative easing and fiscal stimulus taken after the great recession were partially offset by changes in regulatory policyas the chart on the next page illustrates until the great recession of  banks were generally able to lend out  of their depositsin addition they maintained liquidity in the form of securitiesdodd frank created a new rule called the liquidity coverage ratio lcr which required banks to permanently “lock up” a lot more liquidity and also created more restrictions around what counted as liquiditythe new regula tions generally limited liquidity sources to cash deposits at central banks treasuries and a portion of governmentguaranteed securi tiesit should be noted that while the historic bank reserve requirement is now zero it has effectively been replaced with lcr which is substantially the same thing as a reserve requirement but far more stringentin addi tion we obviously saw an increase in capital requirements and their complexitytaken together these changes resulted in the loan todeposit ratio dropping to approximately  – and it is likely to stay approximately there unless regulations are changedwhile loans are of course subject to supply and demand this is a structural reduction that was clearly due to regulatory changesthe effect was also enduring as banks phased in these rules this new restriction limited their ability to extend credit and that in turn may have held back the economy from reaching its maximum potential outputto understand this in more specific terms look at the chart on the next page that shows prior to the covid recession banks had  trillion in deposits and only  trillion in loansthis  trillion in “lost” lending this is in part directly related to the new liquidity requirements may very well have contributed to the secular stagnation experi enced in the last decadeif  trillion more had been lent the banking sector would have fostered a more dynamic economy and gdp growth over the past decade would almost certainly have been fasterbut many companies large and small may not have survived had jpmorganchase not taken extraordinary efforts to help themwhile the government’s actions were a benefit to banks there is no question the banks were able to weather a terrible storm while reserving extensively for potential future loan lossesimportantly the fed conducted two additional severely adverse comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar stress tests which projected bank results under extreme unemployment gdp loss market disruption and a smaller government stimulusthe result showed that banks could withstand this extreme outcome while continuing to finance the economyi also have very little doubt that if the severely adverse scenario played out jpmorganchase would perform far better than the stress test projections   vcovid and the economy if you aren’t convinced yet – consider how surprising it is that  trillion of quan titative easing qe and deficit spending averaging  of gdp over the year period after the great recession did not result in higher gdp growth and possibly higher infla tionas a reference point in the mids there was no qe – and deficit spending hit  which many people thought was the main reason for the overheated economy and inflation which at its peak was overand so why did all this quantitative easing not have the effect you would have thought qe was never effectively tried prior to the great recession and it is different from fiscal spendingqe is the purchase of securi ties from security holders who tend to rein vest in the same or similar securitiesclearly qe reduces interest rates pushes up asset prices and creates some spending through the wealth effectqe on the one hand may have some inflationary effects mostly on asset pricesbut on the other hand it also may have some disinflationary effects – lower interest rates themselves which is an input cost for businesses and lower income to savers – which may reduce consumption and may increase the propensity to save eg we may need to set aside more money to protect retirement incomeand finally in this most recent round of qe much of the money simply made a round trip – because of the new liquidity rules it ended up back as deposits at the fed not as loansthe fiscal deficit is pure and simple giving various individuals and institutions money to spend – which they will spend over timeall things being equal this is and always has been inflationaryof course in a reces sionary environment with low inflation like after the great recession this might be precisely what is needed without causing overheating or excessive inflationmy own view the anemic growth in the decade after the great recession was due to some of the factors i mention above but also due to many of the public policy failures that i outline in the next section  r

the two years combined is projected to total  trillion or about  of gdpthese numbers are far larger than the first couple of years of the great recession and it is important to note that the rest of the world is showing similar actions compounding the global effectas another reference point during world war ii the deficit hit almost  and it averaged  over the fiveyear period from  tothis period did not create lasting inflation as the circumstances were completely different – we were coming out of a deep depression and the money was spent financing a warcircumstances and starting points matterbefore the great recession you had an over leveraged financial system and overleveraged consumersfor years after the great reces sion there was a massive deleveraging in the united states by consumers many investors and financial institutions somewhat due to regulationstoday this is not the casein the united states the average consumer balance sheet is in excellent shapethe consumer’s leverage is lower than it has been in  yearsin fact prior to the last  trillion stimulus package we estimate that consumers had excess savings of approxi mately  trillioncorporations also have an extraordinary amount of cash on their balance sheet estimated to be approxi mately  trillionand the financial system and investors have already adopted more conservative leverage requirements due to regulations – so they have very little need to deleveragethe qe in this goaround will have created more than  trillion in deposits at us banks and unlike the qe after the great recession a portion of this can be lent outi have little doubt that with excess savings new stimulus savings huge deficit spending more qe a new potential infrastructure bill a successful vaccine and euphoria around the end

for everyonewhile equity valuations are quite high by almost all measures except against interest rates historically a multiyear booming economy could justify their current priceequity markets look ahead and they may very well be pricing in not only a booming economy but also the technical factor that lots of the excess liquidity will find its way into stocksclearly there is some froth and speculation in parts of the market which no one should find surprisingas captain louis renault said in casablanca “i’m shocked shocked to find that gambling is going on in here” conversely in this boom scenario it’s hard to justify the price of us debt most people consider the year bond as the key refer ence point for us debtthis is because of two factors first the huge supply of debt that needs to be absorbed and second the notunreasonable possibility that an increase in inflation will not be just temporaryin  the federal reserve bought essen tially  of all new issuance of treasury notes and bondsin  with the fed’s current qe commitments the market not the fed will have to absorb  trillion in government debt – approximately  of which will be in longer duration maturitiesthis is a large number even for the united stateswe should also remember that many if not most buyers of us debt are essen tially required to buy ie foreign central banks banks insurance companies foreign exchange reserve managers and duration hedgersa notable exception is investors who buy the year bond to take riskoff positionshowever all of these buyers will seek out alternatives – and there are always some – if they become worried about the longterm sustainable value of treasury bondsand remember annual inflation is already running atwe don’t know what the future holds and it is possible that we will have a goldi locks moment – fast and sustained growth inflation that moves up gently but not too much and interest rates that rise but not too mucha booming economy makes managing us debt much easier and makes it much easier for the fed to reverse qe and begin raising rates – because doing so may cause a little market turmoil but it will not stop a roaring economyand of course being who we are while we are going to hope for the goldilocks scenario – and we think there is a chance for that to happen – we will anticipate and be prepared for two other negative scenarios  the new covid variants may be more virulent and resistant to the vaccine which could obvi ously reverse a booming economy damage the equity markets and reduce interest rates as there is a rush to safety and  the increase in inflation may not be temporary and may not be slow forcing the fed to raise rates sooner and faster than people expectmuch of the stimulus may very well hit when the economy is doing quite wellduring the pandemic it was appropriate that fiscal and monetary policy be fairly well coordinated – working in concert to counter the pandemicrelated downturnin an infla tionary case fiscal and monetary policy may very well be at oddsi am reminded of when paul volcker effectively raised interest rates by  basis points on a saturday nightalso in this case the cost of interest on us debt could go up fairly dramatically making things a little worserapidly raising rates to offset an overheating economy is a typical cause of a recessionone other negative in this case we would be going into a recession with an already very high us deficitthe government did the right thing by moving extraordinarily quickly to stop the covid recession from being extremely damagingif we spend this

with overlap ping rulemaking oversight and examination authoritiesall of the agencies are indepen dent and there is no one real authority that can coordinate all the moving parts and bridge differencesthe financial stability oversight council chaired by the ussecretary of the treasury is really just a convening body – no one agency has the ability to adjudicate deci sionsany one agency can hold up major deci sions – and this unnecessarily politicizes and slows the regulatory policymaking processwe don’t give our regulators the political cover they needproper regulation requires a finely tuned thoughtful and oftenchanging balance between competing needs and risksthis in particular puts the federal reserve the key oversight regulator in a terrible positionmonetary policy is so critical to our country that the fed must necessarily subju gate and sacrifice regulatory policy to achieve its monetary policy goalsthat said i will look at the regulatory system from the regulators’ point of view and describe what i would want to do if i were in their shoeslet’s start with basic regulatory principles • ensure that safety and soundness come first but not at the expense of maximum longterm growth • keep the banks funding their clients through the inevitable downturns and crises • create a fairly level international playing field we don’t need to see perfection here but it needs to be fair • constantly assess emerging risk to the system doddfrank workedwhile doddfrank included a lot of things that had nothing to do with safety and soundness and the great recession to be fair it accom plished its basic objectives – higher levels and quality of capital and liquidity more strin gent stress testing strong resolution capabil ities and better governance that created a far healthier banking system which we’ve just seennothing like what happened to the banks in the great recession can happen againbut it’s bogged down in the past — it needs to focus on the futureit is obvious however that we are bogged downten years after the financial crisis we still have not put the finishing touches on basel iii aka basel ivand it’s not clear when it’s finished if it will be an international level playing fieldin addition there are many things that need to be recalibratedfor example we have not corrected mortgage rules to make mortgages more accessible to more americansnot only are we slow in dealing with the past but it distracts us from dealing with the futurethere are serious emerging issues that need to be dealt with – and rather quickly the growth of shadow banking the legal and regulatory status of cryptocurren cies the proper and improper use of financial data the tremendous risk that cybersecurity poses to the system the proper and ethical use of ai the effective regulation of payment systems disclosures in private markets and effective regulations around market structure and transparency payment for order flow highfrequency trading and exchangeswe need to actively decide what we want in the regulatory systemregulators need to decide what they want included in the regulatory system – and what they don’t want includedthey can do this by product and by service however to do so they need to apply the same rules to everyonewe need to recognize that if a regulated system has higher capital require ments than the market demands then the product will move outside of the regulated systemif we are going to do this we should do it deliberately and with aforethoughttoday there are extensive differences between the requirements placed on banks versus nonbanks engaging in the same activityi will give one example of the impact of market capital versus regulatory capitalunder standardized capital whether we  vcovid and the economy  make a aa loan or a bb loan approximately  of equity capital is required to support it plus other expensive debtin the nonbank market institutions and securitizations can possibly finance the investment grade debt effectively with  equity capitalironically this pushes highgrade credit out of banks and incentivizes more risky lendingwe need to calibrate how much liquidity and capital should be required for banks in a way that balances what you want in the regulatory system while maximizing both safety and soundness of banks and the growth of the economyone day someone is going to ask why the banking system has  trillion either in the form of cash or deposits at the fed or as treasury securitiesshouldn’t we use some of this liquidity to help the economy grow it’s a good question and i’ve yet to see agreement on the right answerunder the old regulatory regime banks could turn to the fed’s discount window to create a tremendous amount of liquidity by pledging their securities and loans at times of surging demand – it no longer works this wayin today’s regime using the discount window is so stigmatized that far fewer banks consider it a viable option meaning that liquidity never reaches the banking system and by default the broader economythis calibration will be one of the main factors in determining what ends up in the regulatory system – and what doesn’tit is a fine balancetoo much capital and liquidity could possibly slow down the economy and push lots more to the shadow banking systemtoo little capital and liquidity could make banks riskier and more subject to failureand remember products and services inside a wellregulated system will generally have higher scrutiny transparency and reporting supporting themthis decision will be a key factor in determining the probability of a large bank’s failure which raises the question … should large banks be allowed to fail it is very easy to take one side of this argu mentafter the great recession of  the answer was generally “never again” the system was rebuilt to minimize the odds so that no large bank would ever fail again – regardless of the consequencesthe fed has to decide if it is willing to accept a large bank failure provided that failure isn’t going to bring the market down or put the average customer in harm’s wayto me the obvious answer should be “yes” the market can easily absorb a bank failure particularly since the government now has the tools to have an orderly unwind of even the largest financial institutionsin addition if you look at the market price of bank debt failure is priced in just like all other corporates – bank debt and bank preferreds are not cheapthe market can deal with the failure of bank debt – in fact resolution maximizes the odds of recovering your moneythe cost to the economy of having failsafe banks may not be worth itdoddfrank accomplished two very important thingsfirst the chance of a bank failure is dramatically lowersecond and maybe more important a failing large bank can be managed in a way that it does not affect the economy any more than any other large company that failsa yoke that is too tight may throttle the economyfinally banks need to be allowed to properly manage their capital to maintain any kind of premium in the marketproper capital management means consistent dividends the ability to reinvest in your business and incentives to buy back stock when it’s cheap – not when it’s expensivethe procyclicality of both accounting and bank regulatory management virtually assures the oppositeit is one of the reasons that bank stocks may not trade particularly wellwe need to decide who we want to intermediate in the markets when there is stressseveral times in the last few years you have seen dislocation in our repo markets trea sury markets and in march  all of our marketsin many cases the fed has had to step in to intermediate and help finance these marketspart of the reason for this is the probably unintended confluence of new regulationswe now manage our bank to try to maxi   vcovid and the economy mize and optimize across more than  capital and liquidity factors we run the bank to serve customers but we maximize capital and liquidity requirements for economic reasonsbut the confluence of three main constraints the lcr the supplementary leverage ratio slr rule and gsifi created red lines that we cannot crossover the past two years we saw significant dislocation in the ustreasury ust repo markets which were certainly linked to these regulationsat those moments of stress by simply reducing the regulatory cost of ust repo we could have supplied hundreds of billions of dollars in additional ust financing to the market this activity would be properly collateral ized and very safe – and remember we are only one market playerin addition when the market had high stress we could also have lent hundreds of billions of dollars against corporate bonds mortgage securi ties or equities to help market participants sell or deleverage in an orderly waywe did much of this in the great recession but today’s new rules precluded us from taking these actions this timejpmorganchase was essentially “the discount window” for the marketplace before doddfrank – we would lend freely against good collateral just as the central bank was the discount window for banks in a crisisthis system is brokenthe main point is that if large players cannot intermediate in markets because of regula tory requirements the fed will have to do it – and far more frequently than just in the worst crisesi do not believe that this is good longterm central bank policyfinally more thought should be given to how stress tests and buffers can and should be used in a financial crisisthe main question is when you are in the depths of a crisis how do you stress test without going down a rabbit hole and is that the time when bank boards are going to allow people to reduce their capital buffers plain and simple coun tercyclical buffers do not workpublic rhetoric and the politicization of complex regulations aside proper design of these systems should be done to maxi mize the health of the us economy for alloverall the banks – and importantly your bank – stand ready to do morethe pandemic accelerated remote working capabilities which will likely carry forwardwhile we are continually preparing for multiple business resiliency scenarios ie data center failures closures of cities major storms even pandemic planning we never prepared for a global pandemic which also entailed a largescale shutdown of the global economyand while many of our employees particularly in the branches continued to work on our premises every day it was amazing how quickly we were able to set up the technology – from call centers and opera tions to trading and investment banking – to enable our employees to work from homewe learned that we could function virtually with zoom and cisco and maintain produc tivity at least in the short runthe covid pandemic changed the way we work in many ways but for the most part it only accelerated ongoing trendsand while working from home will become more permanent in american business it needs to work for both the company and its clientsi believe our firm’s onsite versus remote work will sort out something like this • generally speaking we envision a model that will find many employees working in a location full timethat would include nearly all of the employees in our retail bank branches as well as jobs in check processing vaults lockbox sales and trading critical operations functions and facilities amenities security medical staff and many others  vcovid and the economy  the virtual world also presented some serious weaknessesfor example • performing jobs remotely is more successful when people know one another and already have a large body of existing work to doit does not work as well when people don’t know one another • most professionals learn their job through an apprenticeship model which is almost impossible to replicate in the zoom worldover time this drawback could dramati cally undermine the character and culture you want to promote in your company • a heavy reliance on zoom meetings actu ally slows down decision making because there is little immediate followup • and remote work virtually eliminates spontaneous learning and creativity because you don’t run into people at the coffee machine talk with clients in unplanned scenarios or travel to meet with customers and employees for feed back on your products and servicesfinally we still intend to build our new head quarters in new york citywe will of course consolidate even more employees into this building which will house between  to  employeeswe are extremely excited about the building’s public spaces stateof theart technology and health and wellness amenities among many other featuresit’s in the best location in one of the world’s greatest cities • some employees will be working under a hybrid model eg some days per week in a location and the other days at home • and a small percentage of employees maybe  will possibly be working full time from home for very specific rolesin all cases these decisions depend upon what is optimal for our company and our clients and we will extensively monitor and analyze outcomes to ensure this is the caseof course we will also continue to reopen following health authority and govern ment guidelines and our own established processesremote work will change how we manage our real estatewe will quickly move to a more “open seating” arrangement in which digital tools will help manage seating arrangements as well as needed amenities such as conference room spaceas a result for every  employees we may need seats for only  on averagethis will significantly reduce our need for real estate  our nation is clearly under a lot of stress and strain from various events the covid pandemic of course which has taken more american lives than the total lost in world war ii the korean war and the vietnam war combined resulting in acute economic distress for millions more the brutal murder of george floyd and the racial unrest that followed the divisive  presidential election culminating in the storming of the capitol and the attempt to disrupt our democ racy and the seemingly inevitable but none theless alarming and unnerving rise of china threatening america’s global preeminenceamerica has faced tough times before – the civil war world war i the us stock market crash of  and the great depression that followed and world war ii among othersas recently as the late s and s we struggled with the loss of the vietnam war political and racial injustice recessions inflation and the emergence of japan as an economic powerbut in each case ameri ca’s might and resiliency strengthened our position in the world particularly in relation to our major international competitorsthis time may be differentchina’s leaders believe that america is in declinethey believe this not only because their country’s sheer size will make them the largest economy on the planet by  but also because they believe their longterm thinking and competent consistent leader ship have outshone america’s in so many waysthe chinese see an america that is losing ground in technology infrastructure and education – a nation torn and crippled by politics as well as racial and income inequality – and a country unable to coordi nate government policies fiscal monetary industrial regulatory in any coherent way to accomplish national goalsunfortunately recently there is a lot of truth to thisperhaps we were lulled into a false sense of security and complacency in the last two decades of the th century as we enjoyed relative peace in the world and a position of global dominance validated by the fall of the soviet unionduring those two decades we experienced relatively unin terrupted and strong growth resulting in broad improvement in income for almost all americansthat stability was shattered by the september   terrorist attacks which were followed by nearly  years of overseas combat for american soldierseconomic growth over the last two decades including the great recession of  has been painfully slow with increasing income inequality and virtually no growth in income at the lower rungs of the economic

effects – inequities that had been there for a long timeonce more our country suffered and its least welloff individuals suffered the mostunfortunately the tragedies of this past year are only the tip of the iceberg – they merely expose enormous failures that have existed for decades and have been deeply damaging to america  today the united states and other countries around the world are grappling with many other critical issuesto name just a few capitalism versus other economic systems access to healthcare immigration policy the role of business in our society and how or even whether the

perhaps for good reason many of our prob lems have been around for a long time and are not aging wellpolitics is increasingly divisive and government is increasingly dysfunctional leading to a number of poli cies that simply don’t workamericans know that something has gone terribly wrong and they blame this coun try’s leadership the elite the powerful the decision makers – in government in business and in civic societythis is completely appropriate for who else should take the blame and people are right to be angry and feel let downour failures fuel the populism on both the political left and rightbut populism is not policy and we cannot let it drive another round of poor planning and bad leadership that will simply make our country’s situation worseto explain how and why this all happened we tend to look for convenient reasons – some blame greed and “shorttermism” some blame immigration and others blame the uncontrolled effects of new technolo gies trade or chinamany of our citizens are unsettled and the fault line for all this discord is a fraying american dream – the enormous wealth of our country is accruing to the very fewin other words the fault line is inequalityand its cause is staring us in the face our own failure to move beyond our differences and selfinterest and act for the greater goodthe good news is that this is fixablesome americans think that the country’s cando attitude innovative entrepreneurism and great resiliency which served us so well in prior crises still exist and will reemerge to help us selfcorrectat the other end of the spectrum there are those who think we are simply a great empire whose glory days have passed and we should cede global leadership to chinathese advocates would add that democracy itself does not work – our failures being prime evidence of democracy’s ineffec tivenessboth views fall shortthe problems that are tearing at the fabric of american society require all of us – govern ment business and civic society – to work together with a common purposeand that common purpose should be our ongoing quest to be a more perfect union and to maintain america’s preeminent role in the worldto do this we need to demand more of both ourselves and of our leadersand we can’t fix our problems if we don’t acknowl edge them and the damage they have causedhoping that things will selfcorrect is not a strategy – working on solutions isone last thing the raw power of america is often represented by our incredible military mightin reality however our raw power emanates from our economic vitality and strength which have always been predi cated upon freedom free enterprise and the promise of increasing equality and opportu nity for allif income inequality is the fault line returning to the basic morality at the core of america’s founding principles can lead us to a common purpose and help bind us together again  vipublic policy american exceptionalism competitiveness and leadership challenged by china

reasons why men aged  are permanently out of work in addition  of americans don’t have enough savings to deal with unexpected expenses that total as little as  such as medical or car repair billsthis obviously adds to the economic anxiety of our lower paid peopletrillions of government dollars were spent on social programs even before these latest crises – clearly our broken systems leave too many of our fellow citizens trappedsimply put the social needs of far too many of our citizens are not being metand surprisingly approximately  of those eligible for various types of federal assistance programs don’t get the help to which they’re entitledwhat actually are our problems if we can agree on what they are as well as their symptoms and their causes then we can start to address themi hope you find what i’m about to say as painful as i dowhile the average american high school graduates approximately  of its students many of our inner city schools don’t grad uate half of their students and often don’t give our children an education that leads to a livelihoodno one can claim that the promise of equal opportunity is being offered to all americans through our educa tion systemsour healthcare system is increasingly costly – now over  per person more than twice our global compet itorsin addition almost a decade after the adoption of the affordable care act over  million americans still don’t have any medical insuranceand shockingly life expectancy has gotten worse – particularly for poor and minority communities – nutri tion and personal health aren’t being taught at enough schools and obesity a main driver of diabetes cancer stroke heart disease and depression has become a national scourgeour education and health issues come together in this alarming statistic seventy percent of today’s youth ages  are not eligible for military service essentially due to a lack of proper education basic reading and writing skills or health issues commonly obesity or diabetesof course there’s a litany of other problemsi’ll give some examples but if i tried to address them all this letter would become a bookwe have a litigation and regula tory system that is costly crippling small businesses with red tape and bureaucracy terrible infrastructure planning and invest ment and huge waste and inefficiency atlaying out the problems is painful  vipublic policy american exceptionalism competitiveness and leadership challenged by china covid and our own competence would have driven wages higher and given us the wherewithal to broadly build a better countrytax receipts would have been higher and we easily could have afforded better social safety netsanemic growth may account for our wors ening productivity and income inequalityincluded among the common explanations for this growth is that “secular stagnation” is the new normal or that there is a “savings glut” faster growth would not only have spurred higher incomes more jobs and increased opportunities but also would have created far more consumption and increased demand for investment eliminating any potential “savings glut” or secular stagnationit is hard to look at these issues in their totality and not conclude that they have a significant negative effect on the great amer ican economic enginemy view is if you add it all up this dysfunction could easily have been a  drag on our growth rateand unfortunately our extraordinary strengths as a nation cover up our weaknessesthis is the new normal – and it does not need to be this waywe should first look at how and why we became so inept at public policywhy did — and didn’t — these failures happen before we discuss how to fix our problems it would be helpful to understand why some of them happened – and why we failed to design and implement good public policiesclearly increasing political partisanship – possibly structural – deserves part of the blame but i’ll leave that subject to othersit’s also clear that our failings are not deliberate since no one wants these terrible outcomeswhat has changed however is the scale of our challenges they are bigger global and increasingly complex and they are happening in a world that is transforming itself far more rapidly than before history teaches us that as a successful society ages the common social purpose that binds it becomes less importantinstead the society becomes more balkanized and often is crip pled by powerful agendas of special interest groups – even if they all have good inten tionslet’s examine some of the reasons why we have failed to design effective policieswe are hampered by shortterm thinking that’s never comprehensiveas a nation we don’t think long term which hampers our ability to design proper policies that are based on thoughtful analysisin my view we don’t perform the deep analysis required to fully understand what we’re trying to solveone of the reasons for this is that our outlook is often too limited ie examining only how things have changed governments both federal and state fight to keep military bases open that we don’t need and veterans affairs hospitals functioning that are broken – making the military more costly and less effectiveour shortcom ings are not just about inefficiencies they border on being immoralin an incredibly depressing story former secretary of defense bob gates describes how congress took years longer than it should have to approve the building of usarmy personnel carriers that we needed in iraq and afghanistan to protect our soldiers from improvised explo sive deviceswhile we dallied many of our soldiers died or received terrible lifelong injuriesalthough the government does certain things well no one believes that it does most things well or that it gives an honest accounting of what it does dowe merely throw up our hands in frustrationall of this broken policy may explain why over the last  years the us economy has grown cumulatively only aboutsome think that this sounds satisfactory but it must be put into context in prior sharp downturns   and  economic growth was  over the ensuing  yearshad we had  more growth our gdp would have added  trillion which certainly  vipublic policy american exceptionalism competitiveness and leadership challenged by china covid and our own competence yearoveryear or even quarteroverquarterwe frequently fail to look at trends over a multiyear period or across decades – and we miss the forest for the treeswhen you step back and take a comprehen sive multiyear view considering the situa tion in its totality it is the cumulative effect of many of our policies that has resulted in our presentday failureswe are overreliant on economic models and use them inappropriatelyeconomic models are a great discipline that force you to think through the interplay of many factors often over many yearsunfor tunately however a lot of people use models like they do certain facts to justify what they already believewhile we should definitely use models as tools they should not be deter minative as they simply cannot account for much of humankindcertain pivotal factors are too complex or qualitative to incorporate into a modelin evaluating a company or the economy for example models quite often fail to prop erly account for culture and morality the character of players involved the increasing importance of education and skills the value of dignity of work the power of selfconfi dence as a secret sauce and the emergence of new technologies just to name a feweven worse many models use inputs that are so inaccurate that their outputs cannot be remotely relied uponfor instance accounting itself particularly government accounting may be the worst culpritgood investments are treated as expenses including education rd and infrastruc ture – indistinguishable from incarcera tion costs and homelessnessand incred ibly federal government budgeting rules like paygo or payasyougo or budget caps mandate that many expenses have to be offset by revenue increases or have to be traded off against other prioritiesthe economy is frustratingly complex and many times overusing models devalues basic commonsensewe cloud debate with unfair thinking and arguingone of the best pieces of advice i have ever received was that people should use their intelligence to seek out the answers not to justify what they already think or to win the argumenthere are some of the favorite tricks people use to win the argument and obviate issues • presenting issues as if they are binarythis is a habit of sloppy thinkingtwo of my favorite quotes illuminate thisone by albert einstein “everything should be made as simple as possible but not simpler” and the second by hlmencken “for every complex problem there is an answer that is clear simple and wrong” we frequently seek out conve nient and simplistic answers which are often wrongthe same is true for how we listeninstead we should try to find common ground with parts of someone’s argument as opposed to rejecting the entirety of it offhand • creating and blaming scapegoats like trade china immigration or capitalismwhile scapegoating is easy it mostly hides the truth – in fact when you dig a little deeper which we do in the following pages other causes possibly selfinflicted become clear • unfairly assigning motives to people which may or may not be truethe goal is simply to denigrate an individual andor win an argument – but this tactic has nothing to do with the actual facts • creating strawmen representing your opponentthis strategy makes it easier to attack foes for things they did not actually think or saymedia hype and people’s willingness to be weaponized derail thoughtful strategiesmuch has been said about the role of social media but some things are clearmost media and individuals barely have time to focus on the issues – and often default to overly  vipublic policy american exceptionalism competitiveness and leadership challenged by china covid and our own competence simplistic binary and incorrect conclusions that neatly fit into false political narrativesthe urgency of today and the hyperactive and frequently hysterical focus on irrelevant issues crowd out thoughtful strategy and policy for tomorrowlack of civility and humility make it hard to work together and to respect each othermoral indignation is blinding – it stops you from trying to agree on what the problems are it disguises itself as policy and it turns expertise into elitismi am often surprised how people allow themselves to be completely riled up – yes it happens to me tooand when politics and media meet we are whipsawed by false argu ments of fanatics the certitude of ideologues and cycles of intolerancewe all should try not to be drawn into this vortexwe are stymied by selfinterest selfishness and the buildup of bureaucratic plaque and institutional sclerosisnow willingly i’m about to go down a slippery slopei’m going to cite some very specific examples but i essentially apply them to all of us and make my point as simply and strongly as possible we are bogged down sometimes crippling our nation because of selfinterest and the asso ciated bureaucracy and bad thinking that followmuch of this is not done deliberately – it’s just built up over time – like arterio sclerosishistorians sometimes point to this disease as a cause of the decline and fall of great empiresthis selfinterest is virtually everywherethere are  registered lobbyist contracts for special interest groups in washington dc including businessrelated groups and banking and financial serviceswe all deserve our share of the blame for using the balkan ized government bureaucracy and lack of transparency to further our own interests – not necessarily the country’sthis includes business unions state and local governments and individualsall of us failed to properly heed president john fkennedy’s appeal “ask not what your country can do for you – ask what you can do for your country” for years business government and commu nity leaders including myself voiced concerns about the inequities and other crises in our economy and communitiesbusiness did not cause many of these soci etal issues – large companies generally pay their workers a higherthanaverage salary offer more training provide more extensive insurance and medical and pension bene fits for their employees and fundamentally drive our country’s growth and competi tiveness as these companies account for approximately  of capital expenditures and rdfrankly we punted too much of the responsibility to our governmentbut we are partly responsible – for we priori tized shareholder interests and sometimes narrow selfinterests over creating broader opportunity for all in americasuccessful businesses can literally and figuratively “drive by” our worst problems think inner cities and still thrivethese large companies can and should be more aggressively part of the solution because they can uniquely help with job planning skills training infrastruc ture investment and community develop mentand doing so over the long run is both morally right and commercially right because it will be good for businessstate and local governments are equally to blametake for instance five states cali fornia connecticut illinois new jersey and new york that continue to fight for unlim ited state and local tax deductions because those five states reap  of the benefit even though they are aware that over  of those deductions will accrue to people earning more than  a yearfew of our institutions are blamelesshospi tals fighting to keep their prices unpublished and teachers’ unions arguing to continue to keep failed schools open are just two such examplesthen there’s our tax code – buried in it

– nor are the solutionsunfor tunately however partisan politics is preventing collaborative policy from being designed and implemented particularly at the federal levelwe would do better if we listened to one anotherdemocrats should acknowledge republi cans’ legitimate concerns that money sent to washington often ends up in large wasteful programs ultimately offering little value to local communitiesthey could acknowledge that while we need good government it is not the answer to everythingdemocrats could also acknowledge that a healthy fear of a large central government is not irrational like a leviathanrepublicans need to acknowledge that america can and should afford to provide a proper safety net for our elderly our sick and our poor as well as help create an environ ment that generates more opportunities and more income for more americansrepubli cans could acknowledge that if the govern ment can demonstrate that it is spending money wisely we should spend more – think infrastructure and education fundingand that may very well mean higher taxes for the wealthyshould that happen the wealthy should keep in mind that if tax monies improve our society and our economy those same individuals will be in effect among the main beneficiariesdemocrats and republicans often seem to be ships passing in the night – with both parties talking at cross purposes even when they may share the same goalscompro mise is not incompatible with democracy – in fact compromise is a core principle of democracywhen major policies are enacted on a purely partisan basis think healthcare and tax reform it virtually guar antees decades of fightingit’s not unrea sonable to think that major policies should be bipartisan or not at allwe must remember that the concepts of free enterprise rugged individualism and entrepreneurship are not incompatible with meaningful safety nets and the desire to lift up our disadvantaged citizenswe can acknowledge the exceptional history of america and also acknowledge our flaws which need redressour problems are complex and frustrating — but they are fixable with hard workif our founding fathers were here today they would be very proud that the constitu tion they enacted has survived thrived and helped to build this great countrybut i also believe they would be disappointedthose leaders were students of history society and economics

should focus on maximizing incentives to get more people working while minimizing incentives for employers to lay off workers especially lowpaid employeessecond we should ensure that federal efforts like the earned income tax credit eitc and the child tax credit are effective enough so that every job essentially pays a living wagethe higher wages resulting from these credits would go a long way toward improving our labor force participation which is a key driver of productivity and economic growthopportunities for jobs we need to make it easier for those with a criminal record to get a job

white adultsthis is institutional racism in its clearest formreforms to the criminal justice system and business screening and hiring practices can open the door of opportunity to significantly more

work hard could get a job at a manufacturing plant that would soon lead to a living wage and the ability to earn a middleclass incomethat may no longer be the casetoday it may be that unskilled or lowskilled workers would not natu rally earn a living wageall jobs are good jobs they bring dignity people who start working generally continue working and the first job is often the first rung on the

are a complete mishmash of uncoordinated federal state and local policiespeople qualifying for public benefits may be eligible for various programs but often don’t apply because they are unaware illinformed or unable to navigate the complexitiesthese programs frequently have different applications and application processes including different places to apply with benefits often disap pearing at different income levels and at different speedsit is accurate to say that the complexity and variability in eligibility rules have negative consequences for both program administration and access to assistancefor example beneficiaries often have to provide the same information for different federal programs and visit multiple offices in order to applythe government accountability office has provided reports about this maze of programs to congress in addition the center on budget and policy priorities has created guides for state and local use to help streamline the application and enrollment process utilizing eligibility determinations made by other programs to jumpstart approvalspublic assistance programs need to be coordinated consolidated and connected to trends in the larger economy as well as to the individual’s transition to employ mentfor example unemployment insur ance should have automatic stabilizers that increase benefits when and where jobs are lacking and reduce them when and where jobs are abundantapplication to all social welfare benefits should be available through one single form and phased in and phased out on a common grid not on a cliffcoordi nated with an individual’s transition to work benefits should gradually be reduced making them a true safety netfinally providing affordable childcare programs or lowering the starting age for public school would make it far easier for parents to worksome countries are now implementing universal access to preschool for children at three years of agethis is a wonderful policyit makes childcare less expensive and has proved to be extraordi narily good for student education over the short and long termparents like it tooof course the benefits may not be fully realized for years but this is precisely the type of longterm thinking in policymaking that we needwomen in particular suffered in the covid crisis as an estimated  million left the workplace largely because they had to become

reportingcompanies perform extensive budgeting planning and reporting some of it conducted on a multiyear basisreal investments – in training data centers manufacturing plants and other categories – are needed on a multi year basis and cannot be stopped and started without incurring enormous additional costsbut this stopping and starting is exactly what takes place in the federal government which inevitably leads to waste and inefficiencyone striking example the military esti mates that it spends more money per year on procurement than is necessary because of this inefficiencyin total the stopstart nature of our government’s budgeting processes most certainly costs us tens of billions of dollars a year in complete wasteproper budgeting and planning – on a multiyear basis – should be implemented at all levels of governmentit is particularly important that most federal programs – think military infrastructure and education – have good longterm plans and be held accountable to execute themwhen the government talks about spending money it should not lead with the amount spent or budgeted to be spent – as if that’s the measure of successinstead the expected outcome of the spending and then the actual outcome should be describedwe desperately need honest and transparent accounting accountability and evaluation about every thing we fund with government dollarsevery department should have an outcome reportit would be beneficial to review government accounting practices and look for a better way to differentiate between investments and expenses for instancethere are also examples that show it would be good if the government conformed to public company accounting particularly around how it accounts for loans and guaranteesan honest accounting would go a long way to rebuilding trust in government – and in government spendingwe need proper management and periodic review of regulatory red tape and bureaucracythe american cando system is now being bogged down

circumstancesclearly this would have to be done in such a way as to ensure that the aggrieved parties are not denied appropriate access to our justice systemthe cost of the now over  million federal

requirements and anyone who deals with the application process knows how wasteful and unnecessary it can bered tape like this cripples small businesses and worse reduces the formation of new enterprisesvery often local regulations are simply a form of lowlevel corruption in which bureaucrats are paid to slowly … move … paper … aroundsmart regulation includes continual improvement constant

honestlybad regula tion often stifles competition – think of the airlines and telecom industries before they were deregulatedhere are few examplesthe federal avia tion administration is unable to adopt new technology for air traffic control which most of the world has already adopted that would reduce the average flight time by more than  minutes and reduce greenhouse gases bypresident dwight deisenhower’s feder alaid highway act of  was  pages long and originally authorized  billion for the construction of the interstate highway system during a year period creating a  mile interstate highway networkand  years later the interstate highway system was largely builtfast forward to current times it took  years and  local state and federal approvals to rebuild the bayonne bridge connecting staten island and new jersey which was badly in need of replacement and was in fact quite dangerous to crossif this is the way we are going to go about fixing our infrastructure we will never get it doneand it’s not just the time element – long delays increase the costs and risks involvedwe need to properly invest on an ongoing basis in modernizing infrastructurevirtually everyone agrees that we have done a woefully inadequate job investing in our infrastructure – from highways ports and water systems to airport modernization and other projectsone study examined the effect of poor infrastructure on efficiency for example poorly constructed highways congested airports with antiquated air traffic control systems aging electrical grids and old water pipes and concluded this could all be costing us hundreds of billions of dollars per yearsome economists estimate that a proper infrastructure investment plan could add  growth annually to our gdp – and it would improve competitiveness across many industries while opening up new investment opportunitiessuch a plan would also create many new jobs with competitive salaries and spur workforce innovationit could intentionally provide employment opportunities for disadvantaged and young workers including those with a criminal backgroundthere are many efficient ways to properly build and finance infrastruc ture from the local state and federal level or publicprivate partnerships which have the added benefit of increasing the invest ment disciplineit is important to point out however that building ineffective “bridges to nowhere” while temporarily creating jobs is actually a huge value destructorthis kind of waste would ultimately undermine ameri cans’ faith in our systemwe need proper and consistent tax and fiscal policy — done right it can actually help drive healthy growth and improve income equalityit would be good to have a tax and fiscal strategy which is premised upon maxi mizing healthy growth and redistributing income effectivelyit would include the following featuresa system that is consistent highly trans parent and as simple as possiblea tax collection system that enables collec tion of all taxes owedmy view is that everyone should pay the taxes they owe and it should be strictly enforcedmany estimates project that with increased head count and greater input from data scien tists we could collect between  billion and  billion more per yeara target for what the federal government should expect to collect in taxes over timea good starting point would be  of gdp it has been running at an average of about  over the last decadein good times we should run a small surplus  and in bad times we should have a small deficit  such that debt to gdp stays fairly constant over timea side benefit of this is that the government would know that it would have more money to spend – but only if we growwe should think about good taxes and bad taxes in terms of spurring growthtaxing primary capital formation or labor are growth reducershaving capital retained and reinvested in the united states should  vipublic policy american exceptionalism competitiveness and leadership challenged by china covid and our own competence be a sine qua non for healthy growth and that means that our business tax rates should be globally competitivetoday the average corporate tax rate for oecd nations is around  versus ourthe retention and reinvestment by businesses of capital in the united states is ultimately the primary driver of productivity and growtheven if that capital is distributed in dividends or stock buybacks it is simply being put to a higher and better use – this is completely normal capital reallocationthe free flow of money capital and human capital is funda mental to our growth and innovation and fundamental to our freedoms as individualsunfortunately taxes that minimize damage to growth would involve taxing high incomesthe wealthy are less likely to complain about taxes if the money is actually used to help the less fortunate or help build a better countryeven with the redistribution of income there will be items that help growth and items that hurt growthredistributing income through the eitc will be money spent to improve labor force participationredistributing money to inefficient and poorly run bureau cracies will not improve growthin addition there is a maze of tax breaks in the tax code that should be eliminatedthere are hundreds of examples but i will mention just a few carried interest the special tax breaks for race cars private jets and horse racing and a special land conser vation tax break for golf courseshidden tax breaks have the additional stigma of being perceived by the american public as just another example of institutional bias and favoritism toward special interest groupsif the wealthy paid more in taxes and the money was put to good use they would be the main beneficiaries of a stronger economydue to government stimulus packages as a result of the covid crisis external government debt to gdp is now a highwe can afford that percentage and even more particularly because interest rates are lowbut in  to  years mostly because of outofcontrol healthcare expenses the debttogdp ratio will start to rise dramati cally – and at some point that will become a problemthe sooner we deal with it the betterthe best way to counteract that is with healthy growthafter world war ii in  the united states still had a  debttogdp ratio which over the next  years fell tothis was not because the government raised taxes or dramatically cut expenses but because the country grew at almost  for the decadewe need intelligent industrial policybeing a free market economy the united states has never been a great believer in governmentdriven industrial policybut we have done it and ought to do it intelligently in discrete areas that make sense and where free markets alone don’t necessarily provide needed products or services such as rural broadband healthcare and cybersecuritywe also need to boost our investment in rd we’re now  in the world in terms of gdp spend on rdgovernment rd could focus on ai and quantum computing climate innovation and other areaswe need thoughtful trade policiesthe united states needs to take a leadership role in establishing global free and fair trade rulesif we don’t they will likely be estab lished to the detriment of american busi nessfree and fair trade rules do not have to be completely equivalent and reciprocal – just fairworking with our allies and other countries we should negotiate the gold stan dard of trade – not just rules around tariffs but fair regulations that address subsidies to statecontrolled enterprises and other forms of unfair competition bilateral investment and protection for intellectual property among other issuesin addition we should recognize that trade while positive for the united states as a whole has caused the loss of jobs both in specific geographies and in specific industriesamericans who have been affected by these disruptions need better support in terms of income assistance retraining and relocation  vipublic policy american exceptionalism competitiveness and leadership challenged by china covid and our own competence we need to maintain a strong financial systemthe united states has the best financial system in the worldthis financial system encompasses asset managers investors banks investment banks private equity hedge funds pension plans and shadow bankingit is protected and enhanced by the rule of law including banking laws and it offers investor protections and transparency around gover nance and accounting and provides complete and free access to global investorswhile nothing is ever perfect and can always be improved upon most of the world would give an arm and a leg for our systemthe free flow of credit and investments – disci plined capital allocation – is critical to being globally competitiveit is the flywheel of the economy as capital is seeking out good invest ments across the risk spectrum and individ uals and ideas that drive growth and innova tiona country’s economy can hardly be better than its financial system and vice versathe united states’ extraordinary and open economy gives us the extraordinary privilege of being the world’s reserve currencythe us dollar is the currency of choice for the majority of trade transactions and it is held by governments central banks and corpora tions as the reserve currency approximately  trillion or  of total world reservesthis helps provide cheaper financing for the united states and gives us enormous clout in foreign and economic policyhowever we should not overly “weaponize” the dollar and we should use this authority judiciously and in support of building a healthy global economy see accompanying feature that followsthe united states has the best financial system in the world and we must strive to maintain itwhile there may be faith involved the us dollar is the reserve currency of the world for a reasonfirst the dollar is supported by the full faith and credit of the united statesthe dollar which is a liability of the federal reserve ie the federal government in digital or in currency form is always supported by an asset — and that asset is generally treasury bondstreasury bonds are supported by the full taxing authority of the us government which in turn is supported and paid for by the full power of the us economythese assets and liabilities including the economy are supported by powerful institutions the rule of law and ultimately the full might of the us militaryof course a central bank can debase a currency but our central bank the federal reserve is meant to protect the currency’s valuefaith is only a small part of these calculationssecond and equally important the us dollar is the world’s reserve currency because anyone who legally has a us dollar can move it freely around the world buy and sell what they want and invest in the united statesby comparison the chinese currency the renminbi rmb cannot be freely moved around the world it can leave china only in limited amounts and can be invested only as the chinese see fitit is subject to their laws and regulationswhile the chinese have done a good job building their economy and are slowly moving toward a more transparent society and financial system they are a long way from having a currency that is fully “convertible” like the us dollaras an aside jpmorganchase moves more than  trillion  digital a day for more than  million payments  digitalapproximately  of value is done the same day  is done in real time and  is executed the same daywhen these dollars are moved they go through extensive screening for risk and fraud matterswhile systems can always be improved upon this process seems to be safe and efficientthe usdollar is the world’s reserve currency for a reason  vipublic policy american exceptionalism competitiveness and leadership challenged by china covid and our own competence we need proper immigration policiesthirty percent of foreign students who receive an advanced degree in science tech nology or math  students annually have no legal way of staying here although many would choose to do somost students from countries outside the united states pay full freight to attend our universities but many are forced to take the skills they learned here back homefrom my vantage point that means one of our largest exports is brainpowerwe need more thoughtful immigration policies that will prevent such a brain drainin addition  of the growth of our workforce over the past  years has come from immigrantstoday we have  million undocumented people living and working in our country on average they have resided in the united states for more than  yearsmost americans would like a permanent solution to daca deferred action for childhood arrivals as well as a path to legal status for lawabiding taxpaying undocumented immigrantsamericans also would like to see and deserve to see border security and there would be far more support for immigration reform if it included proper border securitythese issues are tearing the body politic apartthe congressional budget office esti mates that the failure to pass immigration reform earlier this decade is costing us  of gdp a yearimmigration has been one of the great strengths of this country – and we should never forget thataffordable housing remains out of reach for too many americansprior to the covid pandemic the demand for affordable housing significantly outpaced supply in nearly every us countyin addi tion rising home prices made it increasingly difficult for individuals and families to live near their workplace or within easy access to grocery stores pharmacies and other essential servicesthere are many legisla tive actions that could dramatically increase the availability and affordability of housing offering tax credits and changing local zoning laws are two exampleswhile the subprime mortgage crisis and the recession that followed were terrible the overreac tion to it made housing too costly for many individuals without creating more safetyexcessive origination servicing and securiti zation requirements have increased the cost of the average mortgage by approximately  basis pointsthis has mostly affected smaller mortgages and lowerincome individ uals who have a slightly higher delinquent rate – but who still deserve a mortgagein fact jpmorgan analysis shows that conser vatively more than  trillion in additional loans might have been made over a five year period had we reformed our mortgage systemour analysis also indicates that the cost of not reforming the mortgage markets could be as high as  of gdp per yearwe believe that percentage includes an addi tional  billion a year in mortgages that could be written predominantly for lowerin come householdsthis alone could dramat ically lead to growth in america and help lowerincome individuals build wealthwe need to implement several additional programs and policies specifically to assist black and latinx communitieswe need to address hiring and advancement targets help develop minorityowned small businesses and improve financial educa tion products for the unbankedin addition minorityowned small businesses which employ nearly  million people and generate  trillion in annual economic output have been hit especially hard by covid and will need serious assistance going forward including capital to restart and run their businesseswe should consider requiring companies such as grocery stores pharma cies and other retailers to provide locations in lowincome neighborhoods as banks must do this would reduce the cost of goods purchased by minority individuals and increase local hiring and engagementthese efforts would be a form of redress for the lowincome community that is sustainable and reinforcing  vipublic policy american exceptionalism competitiveness and leadership challenged by china covid and our own competence companies can go further by building a more diverse and inclusive workforce including in their top ranks tying executive compensation to diversity commitments developing a more robust pipeline of diverse talent improving supplier diversity cutting ties with customers who make racist comments and treat employees disrespect fully helping young men and women of color get ahead personally and profession ally and increasing the diversity of busi nesses with whom they partnerabove all it means building a company culture that respects and listens to everyonecompa nies might not always get it right but they should keep tryingthe feature in the path forward in section i outlines many of the specific efforts underway at jpmorganchase to help advance racial equitythe cumulative multiyear effect of doing just some of the measures mentioned above would lead to a healthier more resilient and robust and fairer americait is my belief that the underlying us economy is so strong that it could over come many of the things we have failed to do and still grow atif we could grow at  versus  over a year period that would lead to  trillion in additional gdp by the end of the decade or an increase in household income of abouta  growth rate is what we used to have – and it is achievable againthis growth will help all americans but particularly poor and disad vantaged citizens even before implementing special assistance programs by increasing opportunities for better jobs higher incomes affordable housing and other benefitswe owe it to ourselves to restore our compet itiveness our common purpose and our true sense of civility in the pursuit of building a more perfect unionamerica’s global role and engagement are indispensable to the health and wellbeing of americaone of the biggest uncertainties today is america’s role on the world stagea more secure and prosperous world is not only good for the rest of the world but also for our country’s longterm security and pros perityour role in building that more secure world has been and will likely continue to be indispensableit is a complex role and if we don’t fulfill it others will – and not with our best interests in mindit is even more complex now because since the cold war the united states has not had to deal with another great world powernow we have the relentless rise of china which will likely overtake america in the next  years as both the world’s largest economy and the largest financial marketthroughout history the rise of a second great power has always been disruptiveincreasingly and appropriately most of the world including americans looks at our global position particularly our economic and military strength and compares it with that of chinathere is no question that the relationship with and intense competition between the united states and china will be the most critical relationship for the next  years so it is important to deeply understand all of china’s strengths and weaknesseschina has done a good job in building its economy — but it still has a way to goover the last  years china has done a highly effective job of maneuvering itself to this point of economic developmentchina’s leadership has been strategic consistent  vipublic policy american exceptionalism competitiveness and leadership challenged by china covid and our own competence and coherentand unlike developed demo cratic nations it can both macromanage and micromanage its economy and move very fastgovernment officials can pull in a coor dinated way fiscal monetary and industrial policy levers to maintain the growth and employment metrics they want and they have the control and wherewithal to do itunlike western democracies that frequently and increasingly have changes in govern ment leadership and policy approaches china’s system allows for consistent lead ership and consistent execution of policies and regulations over the long termbut their most important economic advantage is their huge home market which they can use to develop their economy and their companiesthey have as a result been able to use this home market to subsidize some very compet itive industriesbut in the next  years the country will have to confront some serious issues the chinese lack enough food water and energy to support their population pollution is rampant corruption continues to be a problem stateowned enterprises are often inefficient corporate and government debt levels are growing rapidly financial markets lack depth transparency and adequate rule of law income inequality is higher than in the rest of the world and their working age population has been

themonly  million people in china effectively participate in the nation’s oneparty political systemno other developed nation has such low participa tiongrowing middle classes almost always demand political power which helps explain why autocratic leadership almost always falters in a larger more complex economyunder autocratic leadership a major risk is the allocation of economic assets capital and people which are over time used to further political interests leading to ineffi cient companies and markets favoritism and corruptionin addition autocratic leadership diminishes the rule of law and transparency – damaging the ability to create a well functioning financial system this certainly restricts the internationalizing of the rmbdisruption of trade is another risk china

uncoordinated way by our japanese and european allieswe should expect china to do only what is in its own selfinterestnear term we expect challenge and conflict to characterize the relationship

perspective america’s gdp per person in  was  and china’s waseven if we do a rather poor job at managing our economy growing at  our gdp per person in  years would beand if the chinese do a good job

Jamie Dimon,  
Chairman and  
Chief Executive Officer
Dear Fellow Shareholders,
As we prepare this year’s annual letter to shareholders, the world is confronting 
one of the greatest health threats of a generation, one that profoundly 
impacts the global economy and all of its citizens. Our thoughts remain with 
the communities and individuals, including healthcare workers and first 
responders, most deeply hit by the COVID-19 crisis. 
Throughout our history, JPMorgan Chase has built its reputation on being 
there for clients, customers and communities in the most critical times. This 
unprecedented environment is no different. Our actions during this global crisis 
are essential to keeping the global economy going and will be remembered for 
years to come.
In these annual letters, I usually cover a range of topics, including a review of 
JPMorgan Chase’s principles, priorities and performance, as well as the broader 
geopolitical issues facing our company and the most critical public policy issues

affecting our country. When the time is right and the future is clearer, I will 
provide a more complete and current view on how this crisis might change 
our strategies around how we run the company, work with our clients and 
governments, and develop public policy solutions. However, right now, as we 
deal with the spiraling effects of this pandemic, I want to focus on what we as 
a bank can do to remain strong, resilient and well-positioned to support our 
colleagues, clients, customers and communities across the globe. 
Looking back on the last two decades — starting from my time as CEO of Bank 
One in 2000 — the firm has weathered some unprecedented challenges, as we 
will with this current pandemic, but they did not stop us from accomplishing 
some extraordinary things. Once again, you should know how grateful and 
proud I am of our more than 200,000 employees around the world. I also want 
to thank Daniel Pinto, Gordon Smith, our Operating Committee, our Board of 
Directors and our senior leaders for the exceptional leadership they have shown 
under the most difficult of circumstances.  
We entered this crisis in a position of strength. 2019 was another strong year 
for JPMorgan Chase, with the firm generating record revenue and net income, 
as well as setting numerous other records across our lines of business. We 
earned $36.4 billion in net income on revenue1 of $118.7 billion, reflecting 
strong underlying performance across our businesses. We now have delivered 
record results in nine of the last 10 years2 and are confident we will continue 
to do so in the future, though it should be expected that our earnings will be 
down meaningfully in 2020. Our largest businesses grew revenue and net 
income for the year, while the firm continued to make significant investments 
in products, people and technology. We grew core loans by 2%, increased 
deposits overall by 5% and generally broadened market share across our 
businesses, all while maintaining credit discipline and a fortress balance sheet. 
In total, we extended credit and raised capital of $2.3 trillion for businesses, 
institutional clients and U.S. customers.

JPMorgan Chase stock is owned by large institutions, pension plans, mutual 
funds and directly by individual investors. However, it is important to remember 
that in almost all cases, the ultimate beneficiaries are individuals in our 
communities. Approximately 100 million people in the United States own 
stock, and a large percentage of these individuals, in one way or another, own 
JPMorgan Chase stock. Many of these people are veterans, teachers, police 
officers, firefighters, retirees, or those saving for a home, school or retirement. 
Your management team goes to work every day recognizing the enormous 
responsibility that we have to perform for our shareholders. 
While we don’t run the company worrying about the stock price in the short 
run, in the long run our stock price is a measure of the progress we have made 
over the years. This progress is a function of continual investments, in good and 
bad times, to build our capabilities — our people, systems and products. These 
important investments drive the future prospects of our company and position 
it to grow and prosper for decades. Whether looking back over five years, 10 
years or since the JPMorgan Chase and Bank One merger (15 years ago), our 
stock has significantly outperformed the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and the 
Standard & Poor’s Financials Index.

Tangible book value over time captures the company’s use of capital, balance sheet and profitability. In this chart, we are looking at 
heritage Bank One shareholders and JPMorgan Chase & Co. shareholders. The chart shows the increase in tangible book value per share;  
it is an after-tax number that assumes all dividends were retained vs. the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500 Index), which is a  
pretax number that includes reinvested dividends.

The results shown above use our stock price as of December 31, 2019. If you 
compare that with our stock price as of March 31, 2020, you would see a 
dramatic change. For example, the overall stock price gain from the date of the 
JPMorgan Chase and Bank One merger was 442% at the end of last year, but 
it dropped to 252% three months later. While that’s still far better than many 
companies’ performance, it illustrates the volatility of returns. 
Unlike past letters, the placement of charts about the performance of our lines 
of business and our fortress balance sheet is different — they can be found in an 
appendix following this letter to peruse at your leisure. Instead, I am going to 
focus my comments in the rest of this letter on issues that relate to our current 
crisis. And while I enjoy sharing my opinion on many other matters, I will avoid 
doing so this year.

Within this letter, I discuss the following:
  
Dealing With an Extraordinary Crisis
1. We go to extraordinary lengths to help our customers — consumers, 
small businesses, midsize companies, large corporations, and state 
and local governments. 
2. We take excellent care of our employees.
3. We make extraordinary efforts to lift up our communities, especially 
in challenging times.
4. We are transparent with our shareholders: What they should expect 
regarding our financial and operating performance in 2020.
5. We are working closely with all levels of government during this 
crisis — and while we will participate in government programs to 
address the severe economic challenges, we will not request any 
regulatory relief for ourselves. 
6. We need a plan to get safely back to work.
7. We need to come together: My fervent hope for America.

A corporation – essentially any institution – 
is a living, breathing organism made up of 
people, technology, institutional knowledge 
and relationships and is generally organized 
around mission and purpose. Entering into 
a crisis is not the time to figure out what 
you want to be. You must already be a 
well-functioning organization prepared to 
rapidly mobilize your resources, take your 
losses and survive another day for the good 
of all your stakeholders. 
No matter the challenge, we manage our 
company consistently with principles that 
have stood the test of time. I have written 
about these inviolable principles often – the 
need for extremely talented and motivated 
employees; a fortress balance sheet that 
allows us to invest in good times and in bad 
times; clear, comprehensive and accurate 
financial, risk and operating reporting to 
DEALING WITH AN EXTRAORDINARY CRISIS
let us make quick and accurate decisions; a 
devotion to our customers and communi-
ties; and continuous investing in technology 
to better serve both our employees and our 
customers. (These principles also underlie 
an organization’s preparedness for tough 
competition – I was going to write this year 
that the competition is back in all of its 
facets. There’ll be more to come on that next 
year.)
We are there for our customers, employees 
and communities in good and bad times 
– we are a port in the storm. It is in the 
toughest of times that we need to use our 
capital and liquidity to help clients – large 
and small. COVID-19 is one of those extraor-
dinary times. Below are some of the things 
we are doing to help our company and our 
customers during this global crisis. 
1. We go to extraordinary lengths to help our customers — consumers, small businesses, 
midsize companies, large corporations, and state and local governments.
First and foremost, we have to be prepared to 
operate under extremely adverse circumstances.
The significant economic fallout from this 
crisis reinforces the critical need to keep the 
global financial system fully functioning – 
and we recognize that our firm is an 
important part of the global economy. 
Therefore, we incorporate plans for resil-
ience in everything we do – resilience for 
hurricanes, data center failures, cyber attacks 
and other issues. And while we had not 
envisioned the effects of a pandemic like 
this one, all of this preparation has paid off 
– and we have been able to accomplish far 
more and far more quickly than we origi-
nally thought possible. It is absolutely 
essential that we be up and functioning for 
all of our customers each and every day. 
How else would we process $6 trillion in 
payments or buy and sell approximately  
$2 trillion in securities and foreign exchange 
transactions for our clients on a daily basis? 
And how else would we raise more than  
$2 trillion of credit and capital for our 
clients each year? Our branches, collectively, 
have 1 million customer visits each day, and 
our combined credit card and debit card 
transaction volume totals $1.1 trillion a year. 
During this crisis, we have been utilizing our 
disaster recovery sites and implementing 
alternative work arrangements globally.  
We now have more than 180,000 employees 
working from home (and quite effectively), 
including traders, bankers, portfolio managers, 
9
DEALING WITH AN EXTRAORDINARY CRISIS
and operations and call center teams across 
the globe. We are ensuring they continue 
to operate at the highest standards with the 
proper technological tools and access so they 
can serve their clients safely and seamlessly. 
Over the past few weeks, we have had nearly 
150,000 concurrent virtual sessions – nearly 
five times our pre-pandemic average – and we 
have capacity in reserve to support signifi-
cantly more demand if necessary.
We’re taking significant steps to help our 
consumer customers.
After Superstorm Sandy, Hurricane Harvey 
and other devastating natural disasters 
around the globe, after wildfires ravaged 
California towns and after a number of 
other tragic events, we stepped up for our 
customers. Today, we are doing the same 
across the country as we work individually 
with customers facing COVID-19-related 
hardships. 
We have been helping our customers, who 
tell us about their financial struggles as a 
result of the crisis, and are offering relief 
measures such as: 
• Providing a 90-day grace period for  
mortgage and auto loan/lease payments 
and waiving any associated late fees.
• Removing minimum payment require-
ments on credit cards and waiving  
associated late fees.
• Not reporting payment deferrals such as 
late payments to credit bureaus for up-to-
date clients.
• Continuing to responsibly lend to  
qualified consumers.
• Waiving or refunding some fees, including 
early withdrawal fees on certificates of 
deposit.
You can learn more about our customer 
response at: www.chase.com/stayconnected.
Of our approximately 5,000 Chase branches, 
we have managed to keep three-quarters of 
them open – and safe – for our customers 
who need our services. In every one of our 
markets, almost all of our 2,300 branches 
with drive-up windows have remained open 
for business, allowing people to maintain 
a safe distance. Our 17,000 bankers have 
continued to take appointments and proac-
tively reach out to customers – helping them 
manage their finances and use our digital 
tools – often letting customers stay home. 
In addition, the vast majority of our 16,850 
ATMs are well-stocked and still functioning 
to provide needed cash to our customers. 
Our call centers have not fared as well; 
many of them have been effectively shut 
down by local restrictions. As the volume of 
calls has increased from customers seeking 
assistance, hold times have also increased. 
We have mobilized quickly to address this 
issue, reminding customers that our digital 
self-service capabilities are always available 
for them to check balances, deposit checks 
or make payments. Additionally, we have 
built new tools – digital and electronic – to 
allow customers to request relief without 
waiting for a specialist. And we are making it 
possible for our displaced phone specialists 
to work from home. 
We are also taking significant action to support 
businesses — small, midsize and large — and state 
and local governments. 
Clearly, some clients may be much more 
vulnerable than others – for example, trans-
portation companies, hospitality enterprises, 
hospitals, utilities and, in particular, small 
businesses that do not have enough capital 
to withstand sudden and sustained down-
turns in income. JPMorgan Chase Institute 
research reveals that 50% of small busi-
nesses have less than 15 cash buffer days, 
reinforcing why small businesses are being 
heavily disrupted by the current crisis and 
10
DEALING WITH AN EXTRAORDINARY CRISIS
will feel the effects for a significant period of 
time – even as more capital from the recent 
federal stimulus program reaches them. 
To support businesses during this current 
crisis, we are doing the following: 
• Prudently extending credit to businesses 
of all sizes for working capital and general 
corporate purposes. For example, in the 
past 60 days alone, we have extended $950 
million in new loans to small businesses.
• Waiving and refunding fees for those 
businesses in need and finding ways 
to help more small businesses through 
resources available at the Small Business 
Administration.
• Servicing clients with additional credit 
through revolving facilities, when appro-
priate, and stepping in to try to help with 
credit when others can’t or won’t.
• Continuing in the ordinary course of busi-
ness to sustain consumers, businesses and 
communities with about $500 billion of 
credit and capital raised every quarter. 
• Continuing to maintain undrawn 
revolving commitments in our wholesale 
businesses, which totaled approximately 
$295 billion as of the close of business on 
March 31, 2020. Companies have already 
drawn down more than $50 billion of their 
revolvers to prepare themselves for the 
crisis (this already dramatically exceeds 
what happened in the global financial 
crisis). Many others have requested addi-
tional credit, which we have been offering 
judiciously – more than $25 billion of new 
credit extensions were approved in the 
month of March alone.
• Continuing the issuance of bonds for 
highly rated companies ($85 billion) – it 
may surprise you that the first quarter of 
2020 will be our largest quarter for invest-
ment grade issuance, led by J.P. Morgan.
• Continuing to support vital institutions to 
keep our communities strong: Increased 
funding in March included, for example, 
$1.9 billion for hospitals and healthcare 
companies, $270 million for educational 
institutions, $360 million for nonprofits, 
and $240 million for state and local 
governments. 
• Continuing to fund construction projects 
essential to our communities (affordable 
housing, food banks and grocery stores) 
through our $5 billion commitment. 
Recognizing the extraordinary extension of 
new credit, mentioned above, and knowing 
there will be a major recession mean that we 
are exposing ourselves to billions of dollars 
of additional credit losses as we help both 
consumer and business customers through 
these difficult times. (We will provide more 
detail on these actions later in this letter.) Of 
course, we are in continual contact with our 
regulators about our actions and efforts. 
We stand ready to assist the government in 
implementing stimulus package benefits to 
support the economy. 
We applaud the speed with which the federal 
government and the Federal Reserve (the 
Fed), as well as other central banks around 
the world, put together a stimulus package 
and other funding benefits to help individ-
uals, businesses, and state and local entities 
across the United States and beyond. Much 
remains to be done to assure these resources 
can be quickly and effectively rolled out. 
We hope to be at the forefront of using this 
assistance to help our customers get through 
what is certain to be a difficult next few 
months. We will not use this relief funding 
for ourselves.
11
DEALING WITH AN EXTRAORDINARY CRISIS
Times like these reinforce that our employees 
are our most important asset – they are 
fundamental to the vibrancy and success of 
our company. Excellence in everything we do 
– from operations and technology to service 
and reputation – depends upon the abilities 
and character of our employees. Our vast and 
diverse team of people serves our customers 
and communities, builds the technology, 
makes the strategic decisions, manages the 
risks, determines our investments and drives 
innovation. Setting aside differing views of 
our complex world and the risks and oppor-
tunities ahead, it is inarguable that having 
such an extraordinary team – people with 
guts, brains and enormous capabilities who 
can navigate whatever circumstances bring – 
is what ensures our future prosperity.
In last year’s letter, I wrote about the 
many ways we take excellent care of our 
employees: competitive wages and compen-
sation, 401(k) retirement benefits, health 
benefits and wellness programs, extensive 
training programs, volunteer and employee 
engagement opportunities, generous parental 
leave policies and much more.
During this pandemic, we have also taken 
extensive steps to protect and support our 
employees and their families. For example:
• We continue to pay employees who are 
at home because they have had potential 
exposure to the virus or whose health is 
higher risk. Additionally, we provide paid 
medical leave to employees who are unwell. 
• We have clinical staff internally to support 
our employees through this difficult time, 
whether it is fielding general inquiries 
related to COVID-19 or locating testing or 
other medical facilities.   
• All employees are receiving five additional 
paid days off to help manage personal 
needs, which may include dependent care, 
child care or other issues.
2. We take excellent care of our employees.
• A special payment of up to $1,000 has 
been granted to full- and part-time 
employees whose job requires them to 
continue working on-site and generally 
whose annual cash compensation is less 
than $60,000.
• All branch employees are being paid for 
their regularly scheduled hours even if 
those hours are reduced or their branch is 
temporarily closed.
• For those who must go to work on-site, we 
are reinforcing both basic and enhanced 
personal and office hygiene measures 
to keep them, their colleagues and their 
clients safe. We have modified business 
operations, staggered shifts, changed 
seating arrangements, closed buildings to 
nonessential visitors and provided addi-
tional equipment where possible. We have 
also intensified nightly and daily cleaning 
of all offices and branches worldwide that 
remain open.
It’s amazing how quickly we have mobilized 
and implemented work-from-home and other 
resiliency measures – in weeks instead of 
months or years. There are great lessons to 
be learned from this experience.
While conditions may sometimes be unusual 
and difficult, we are functioning smoothly. In 
fact, over the last month in certain parts of 
our company, we’ve had the highest volume 
and transaction totals we have ever seen. 
Needless to say, this success would be impos-
sible without our exceptional employees, and 
we recognize our responsibility to support 
both their professional and personal lives 
now more than ever.
12
A DIVERSE AND INCLUSIVE COMPANY IS A STRONGER COMPANY
While the health crisis we are facing supersedes all other topics in this year’s letter, the subject of 
diversity and inclusion is such an important one that I feel compelled to include it. As a firm, we have 
an unwavering commitment to integrity, fairness and responsibility. That’s why any instances of racist 
behavior and discrimination are so deeply unsettling. 
Recently, Daniel Pinto and Gordon Smith, our Co-Presidents and Chief Operating Officers, sent a note to 
employees about steps we’re taking to ensure our values reach all corners of our company. 
Dear colleagues,
We are managing through uncertain times right now and recognize many of you are focusing much of your day on responding 
to the ongoing spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus. While this is a top priority for all of us, we want to make sure you know we 
haven’t lost sight of our commitment to keeping you informed about our ongoing efforts to strengthen our culture. Now, more 
than ever, we need the best of everyone because only together will we get through these unprecedented times. 
As you know, after the media reported on alleged discrimination in our firm last year, Jamie asked Gordon to lead an internal 
team to take a hard look at how we do business so that we could gain a deeper understanding of what more we can do to root 
out racism and discrimination anywhere it exists. 
Challenging our people to be clear-eyed and open to change, we tasked many of our senior leaders from across the firm, from 
multiple lines of business and control functions, to evaluate our policies, procedures and programs firmwide, to ensure they are 
fair for all employees and customers. To be clear, we are looking across the whole firm and at everything we do.
As a result, we’ve identified a number of areas that, with enhanced, scaled or new programming or processes, would serve to 
improve our culture in important ways. For example, we focused on employee and customer complaints — examining common 
themes, where they originated and where opportunity exists to improve. 
We also looked at how employee discretion may affect product accessibility across lines of business. We found opportunities 
to increase awareness about the firm’s Diversity & Inclusion strategy, and we identified a need to expand our diversity 
recruitment efforts to help us hire more diverse talent, and to implement mandatory firmwide training. 
While this work is ongoing, here are five initial areas where work is now underway, including:
Enhancing our employee feedback process
We are looking hard at how we treat an employee complaint when it comes in. We are already working to simplify escalation 
channels so employees are clear on where to submit complaints, in addition to further building out our capabilities across 
complaints to better understand the full scope of the individual’s experience. Feedback suggests that employees are not 
always clear on where to submit complaints, so we are working to identify where improvements are needed.
Employees are encouraged to use existing channels to report inappropriate conduct or discrimination. We will continue to 
strengthen these “listening posts” and reporting channels in an effort to make sure every one of us feels safe and confident 
identifying and reporting inappropriate behavior.
Making it easier for customers to access products and services
We regularly review the products and services we offer to customers, and we are looking for ways to boost customer 
connectivity across our full spectrum of consumer products. To start, we are focusing on: 
• Enhancing ease of navigating and guiding customers through our full range of products and services available across 
our entire branch network; and 
• Re-evaluating the qualification requirements for new product features and benefits. 
We will improve product parameters and strengthen monitoring tools to ensure the exercise of discretion works as intended.
Bolstering our hiring systems to build a more robust pipeline of diverse talent
Attracting the best talent can only be achieved through a dedicated focus on inclusive recruiting, so we are recommitting 
ourselves to this effort. We have made progress in this area, with programs such as Advancing Black Leaders, a program 
13
focused specifically on increased hiring, retention and development of talent from within the black community. Over the past 
four years, we have increased the number of black professionals in our most senior ranks, with the number of black managing 
directors and executive directors up by more than 50 percent. 
In addition, we are expanding our specialized team dedicated to conducting more targeted outreach to recruit diverse talent. 
We will expand on our program to hold hiring managers and recruiters at the highest levels of the company accountable for 
hiring a diverse group of professionals. 
Instituting required firmwide Diversity & Inclusion Training
In order to drive more diverse and inclusive behaviors amongst our leaders, managers, employees and customers, we are 
requiring diversity and inclusion training for all employees at various points throughout an employee lifecycle, including at the 
time of hire, and periodically thereafter. We expect all employees to fulfill these requirements. 
Because the role of the manager is arguably the most critical role in promoting our culture deep into the organization, we will 
make additional manager training mandatory at the time of promotion to a people-manager role, and at the time of promotion 
to a senior leader role, in addition to other developmental moments for managers. We already have training in many parts of 
the organization, including programs like “Journey to Inclusive Teams” and the required unconscious bias training for branch 
managers. We will continue to enhance and embed this required training throughout the manager’s career.
We know that it is essential for managers to be inclusive leaders and we will focus on helping them recognize ways they can be 
intentional about inclusion as they recruit, hire, retain and develop diverse talent.
Increasing the diversity of the businesses we partner with firmwide
We are fully committed to a fair, equitable and inclusive company for our customers, our employees, our partners and our 
suppliers. This is part of every manager’s job, and they will be held accountable. 
The diversity of the businesses we partner with across the firm is just as important as our employee diversity — from the small 
businesses to which we provide access to capital, to our asset managers, to our suppliers and to the companies we assist in 
bringing public. 
We intend to increase diverse representation through structural process improvements in how we select partners and build 
our pipeline.
The firm will also continue to use data and research to further inform the development of products, services, employee 
programs and community investments that help address racial disparities in wealth building. 
This all goes to say our work described above is representative of our deep commitment and is ongoing. It is not a “one 
and done” event. We will remain steadfast, continue to work now and in the future, and remain ever-vigilant in our effort to 
maintain a culture where racism cannot live or thrive. Over the next 30 days, each business will review their current strategies 
and contribute a plan to bring this to life and each business will be held accountable.
Let us say again, we are all the keepers of our culture and we are committed to ensuring that ours is one where all employees and 
customers are treated equally and fairly, and where all of us receive the opportunity and mutual respect we deserve. 
 
 
I can assure you, it did not take one particular story to make us realize that a diverse and inclusive culture 
is important.
We know that too many people are being left behind – particularly in the black community. The Civil War 
ended more than 150 years ago, and we still have not come even close to parity. We need to do more as a 
nation, and we have more to do as a firm.

DEALING WITH AN EXTRAORDINARY CRISIS
3. We make extraordinary efforts to lift up our communities, especially in challenging times.
I believe that our shareholders know 
we make extraordinary efforts to lift up 
our communities, both at a local level – 
supporting schools and work skills training, 
for example – and at the national level, 
helping to formulate policies that are good 
for countries. These policies affect healthcare, 
infrastructure, education and employment, 
including initiatives such as those that help 
people with a criminal background get a 
second chance.
We know that crises like COVID-19 create 
further inequities in society so it is even 
more important that we be present for those 
communities hit hard by the pandemic. 
JPMorgan Chase made a $50 million 
commitment to help address the immediate 
humanitarian crisis, as well as the long-term 
economic challenges people face. Funding 
will be deployed over time with particular 
focus on the most vulnerable people and 
communities, including:
• Immediate healthcare, food and other 
humanitarian relief globally; 
• Help for existing nonprofit partners 
around the world that are responding to 
the crisis in their communities; 
• Assistance to small businesses vulnerable 
to significant economic hardships in the 
United States, China and Europe. 
There is a tremendous amount we do day to 
day – in addition to traditional banking – to 
help the communities in which we operate, 
including the following, some of which you 
might be surprised to know:
• We finance more than $5.5 billion in 
affordable housing each year (including 
residential and commercial lending and 
mortgages in low- and moderate-income 
communities).
• We provide small business loans in low- 
and moderate-income neighborhoods.
• We design products and services to 
promote the financial health of lower- 
income individuals. 
• We support a number of employee- and 
community-based initiatives and philan-
thropic activities, including: 
– Office of Military and Veterans Affairs, 
which sponsors mentorship, devel-
opment and recognition programs 
to support the military and veterans 
working at the firm; 
– Women on the Move, our global  
firmwide effort that empowers female 
employees, clients and consumers; 
– The Service Corps, which mobilizes 
employee volunteers to help nonprofit 
organizations around the world; 
– Advancing Black Pathways, a compre-
hensive program focused on providing 
more opportunities for black people 
and black-owned businesses because 
we know that opportunity is not always 
created equally; 
– Entrepreneurs of Color Fund, which  
is expanding and provides minority 
entrepreneurs with access to capital, 
education and other resources. 
• We expect to finance more than $100 
billion in transactions aimed at supporting 
development in emerging market coun-
tries – in infrastructure, education, health-
care, agribusiness and industry, among 
other investments – to promote the United 
Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals.

DEALING WITH AN EXTRAORDINARY CRISIS
• We are huge supporters of regional and 
community banks, which are critical to 
many cities and small towns around the 
country. We bank approximately 500 of 
America’s 5,000 regional and commu-
nity banks. In 2019, we lent or raised a 
total of $2.6 billion in capital for them. In 
addition, we provide payment-processing 
services for them, we finance some of their 
mortgage activities, we advise on acqui-
sitions, and we buy and sell securities 
for these banks. We also supply interest 
rate swaps and foreign exchange both for 
themselves – to help them hedge some of 
their exposures – and for their clients. For 
4. We are transparent with our shareholders: What they should expect regarding our 
financial and operating performance in 2020.
example, while many community banks 
were seeking more liquidity to serve their 
local communities amidst COVID-19 fears, 
we were able to help approximately 100 
community banks secure $775 million in 
increased cash availability over a three-
week period in March, delivering $1.9 
billion of cash to support their branches 
and ATMs. This is not only a win for our 
clients but also for the communities in 
which they operate.
Of course, we do not know how this crisis 
will ultimately end, including how long it 
will last, how much economic damage it will 
do, or how fast or slow the recovery will be. 
We have always been serious about stress 
testing and run an enormous number of tests 
per week so that we are prepared for most 
crises. But as is often the case, this “actual 
new crisis” – while it shares attributes with 
what is being stress tested – is dramatically 
different from the expected. 
We stopped buying back our stock: We have 
always held the position that the highest 
and best use of our equity is to reinvest it in 
our own business and, of course, to be able 
to withstand tough times. Halting buybacks 
was simply a very prudent action – we don’t 
know exactly what the future will hold – but 
at a minimum, we assume that it will include 
a bad recession combined with some kind of 
financial stress similar to the global financial 
crisis of 2008. Our bank cannot be immune 
to the effects of this kind of stress. 
We will share in detail our latest thinking on 
the impact this crisis will have on our finan-
cials in our first quarter earnings release in 
mid-April; however, to put it in context, here 
is how our shareholders can think broadly 
about a reasonable range of outcomes.
Our 2019 pretax earnings were $48 billion1 
– a huge and powerful earnings stream that 
enables us to absorb the loss of revenues and 
the higher credit costs that inevitably follow 
a crisis. For comparison, the Comprehensive 
Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) results 
for 2020 that we submitted to the Federal 
Reserve in 2019 (which assumed outcomes 
like U.S. unemployment peaking at 10% 
and the stock market falling 50%) showed a 
decline in revenue of almost 20% and credit 
costs of approximately $20 billion more than 
what we experienced in 2019. We believe we 
would perform better than this if the Fed’s 
scenario were to actually occur. But even in 
the Fed’s scenario, we would be profitable 
in every quarter.2 These stress test results 
also show that following such a meaningful 
reduction in our revenue (and assuming we 
continue to pay dividends), our common 
equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio would likely hold 
at a very strong 10%, and we would have in 
excess of $500 billion of liquid assets. 
Additionally, we have run an extremely 
adverse scenario that assumes an even 
deeper contraction of gross domestic 
product, down as much as 35% in the 
second quarter and lasting through the end 
16
DEALING WITH AN EXTRAORDINARY CRISIS
of the year, and with U.S. unemployment 
continuing to increase, peaking at 14% in 
the fourth quarter. Even under this scenario, 
the company would still end the year with 
strong liquidity and a CET1 ratio of approx-
imately 9.5% (common equity Tier 1 capital 
would still total $170 billion). This scenario is 
quite severe and, we hope, unlikely. If it were 
to play out, the Board would likely consider 
suspending the dividend even though it is 
a rather small claim on our equity capital 
base. If the Board suspended the dividend, it 
would be out of extreme prudence and based 
upon continued uncertainty over what the 
next few years will bring.
It is also important to be aware that in both 
our central case scenario for 2020 results 
and in our extremely adverse scenario, we 
are lending – currently or plan to do so – 
an additional $150 billion for our clients’ 
needs. Despite this, our capital resources and 
liquidity are very strong in both models. We 
have over $500 billion in total liquid assets 
and an incremental $300+ billion borrowing 
capacity at the Federal Reserve and Federal 
Home Loan Banks, if needed, to support 
these loans, as well as meet our liquidity 
requirements (these numbers do not include 
the potential use of some of the Fed’s newly 
created facilities). We could, of course, 
make our capital and liquidity buffer better 
by restricting our activities, but we do not 
intend to do that – our clients need us.  
I would like to point out that, as we get closer 
to the extremely adverse scenario, current 
regulatory constraints will limit additional 
actions we can take to help clients – in spite 
of the extraordinary amount of capital and 
liquidity we could deploy.
5. We are working closely with all levels of government during this crisis — and while we will 
participate in government programs to address the severe economic challenges, we will 
not request any regulatory relief for ourselves.
We are just beginning to analyze and work 
with the government on all of their various 
programs. For the most part, these initiatives 
will need the deep involvement of the private 
sector to be properly executed. We intend 
to do everything we can – and as soon as 
possible – to ensure that government support 
is reaching the people who need it most. 
We applaud and support the recent actions 
the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the 
Federal Reserve have taken to try to miti-
gate the economic impact of the COVID-19 
turmoil. The Fed’s overwhelming actions have 
already dramatically reduced the financial 
stress in the system, and there is still more 
they could do if they need to. For example, 
balance sheet expansion, additional lending 
facilities, and changes to capital and liquidity 
requirements are steps designed to ensure 
that more capital will flow through the 
system, which will ultimately allow us to help 
more families and small businesses. These 
actions would bolster the U.S. economy with 
no impact on safety, soundness or regulatory 
oversight. We are working with the govern-
ment to make sure such crisis-relief measures 
are structured to work effectively – there are 
a significant number of details that need to be 
resolved, which I will not go into here. 
While we will aggressively help our 
customers take advantage of these new 
programs (though we must take action 
to protect ourselves from ongoing – and, 
more important, future – litigation risk), 
we want our shareholders to know that we 
have not requested any regulatory relief 
for ourselves. Saying that we will not ask 
for regulatory relief does not mean the 
government shouldn’t change some rules 
and regulations, however. For example, 
some rules can improperly prevent healthy, 
well-capitalized banks from lending freely 
in times of stress. This can hurt customers 
as the crisis deepens. Leaving high-quality, 
available liquidity undeployed in times of 
need is an opportunity forever lost. 
17
DEALING WITH AN EXTRAORDINARY CRISIS
I have written in detail in past letters that 
the regulatory system is in need of both 
reform and recalibration – not because we 
want it to happen but because it would be 
good for a deepening and widening of the 
financial system – something that would 
benefit all Americans. While a lot of the rules 
were constructive and made the financial 
system stronger, we are now seeing the 
impact of poorly coordinated, poorly cali-
brated and poorly organized rulemaking. 
After the crisis subsides (and it will), our 
country should thoroughly review all aspects 
of our preparedness and response. And we 
should use the opportunity to closely review 
the economic response and determine 
whether any additional regulatory changes 
are warranted to improve our financial and 
economic system. There will be a time and 
place for that – but not now. 
6. We need a plan to get safely back to work.
It is hoped that the number of new COVID-19 
cases will decrease soon and – coupled with 
greatly enhanced medical capabilities (more 
beds, proper equipment where it is needed, 
adequate testing) – the healthcare system is 
equipped to take care of all Americans, both 
minimizing their suffering and maximizing 
their chance of living. Once this occurs, 
people can carefully start going back to work, 
of course with proper social distancing, 
vigilant hygiene, proper testing and other 
precautions. There are many jobs that can be 
safely done; however, employees in certain 
companies should return to business as usual 
only if the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) and other government 
entities deem it safe to do so. 
In addition, this “return to work” process 
could be accelerated if federal, state and local 
governments make tests widely available 
that allow people to certify that they have 
contracted and recovered from the disease, 
have the necessary antibodies to prevent 
them from getting sick again and are not 
infectious to anyone. Initially, we need a 
buffer period of days or weeks for people 
to be tested, and then for those who test 
negative for the virus, we need to discover 
whether virus antibodies appear through 
serology testing. Both the CDC and private 
companies are scrambling to produce such 
tests: The U.K. has ordered 3.5 million 
of them, Germany will use them to issue 
immunity certificates to COVID-19 survi-
vors, and China and Singapore already are 
using tests to determine how extensively the 
virus spread in large populations in order 
to measure the true infection rate. In the 
United States, the Food and Drug Admin-
istration is allowing doctors to use these 
serology tests to identify recovered patients 
whose antibodies could treat emergency 
cases of the disease. 
The country was not adequately prepared for 
this pandemic – however, we can and should 
be more prepared for what comes next. Done 
right, a disciplined transition would maxi-
mize the health of Americans and minimize 
the time, extent and suffering caused by the 
economic downturn. 
18
DEALING WITH AN EXTRAORDINARY CRISIS
Sometimes extraordinary events in history 
can cause a change in the body politic. As a 
nation, we were clearly not equipped for this 
global pandemic, and the consequences have 
been devastating. But it is forcing us to work 
together, and it is improving civility and 
reminding us that we all live on one planet.  
E Pluribus Unum. 
I am hoping that civility, humanity, empathy 
and the goal of improving America will 
break through. 
We have the resources to emerge from this 
crisis as a stronger country. America is still 
the most prosperous nation the world has 
ever seen. We are blessed with the natural 
gifts of land; all the food, water and energy 
we need; the Atlantic and Pacific oceans as 
natural borders; and wonderful neighbors in 
Canada and Mexico. And we are blessed with 
the extraordinary gifts from our Founding 
Fathers, which are still unequaled: freedom 
of speech, freedom of religion, freedom 
of enterprise, and the promise of equality 
and opportunity. These gifts have led to the 
most dynamic economy the world has ever 
seen – one that nurtures vibrant businesses 
large and small, exceptional universities, and 
a welcoming environment for innovation, 
science and technology. America was an idea 
borne on principles, not based upon histor-
ical relationships and tribal politics. It has 
and will continue to be a beacon of hope for 
the world and a magnet for the world’s best 
and brightest.
Of course, America has always had its flaws. 
The current pandemic is only one example 
of the bad planning and management that 
have hurt our country: Our inner city schools 
don’t graduate half of their students and 
don’t give our children an education that 
leads to a livelihood; our healthcare system 
is increasingly costly with many of our citi-
zens lacking any access; and nutrition and 
personal health aren’t even being taught at 
many schools. Obesity has become a national 
scourge. We have a litigation and regulatory 
system that cripples small businesses with 
red tape and bureaucracy; ineffective infra-
structure planning and investment; and huge 
waste and inefficiency at both the state and 
federal levels. We have failed to put proper 
immigration policies in place; our social 
safety nets are poorly designed; and the 
share of wages for the bottom 30% of  
Americans has effectively been going down. 
We need to acknowledge these problems  
and the damage they have done if we are 
ever going to fix them.
There should have been a pandemic play-
book. Likewise, every problem I noted above 
should have detailed and nonpartisan solu-
tions. As we have seen in past crises of this 
magnitude, there will come a time when we 
will look back and it will be clear how we – 
at all levels of society, government, business, 
healthcare systems, and civic and humani-
tarian organizations – could have been and 
will be better prepared to face emergencies 
of this scale. While the inclination of some 
will be to finger-point and look for blame,  
I hope we can avoid that. I also hope we can 
avoid people using times of crisis to argue 
for what they already believe. We need to 
demand more of ourselves and our leaders 
if we want to prevent or mitigate these 
disasters. This can be a moment when we 
all come together and recognize our shared 
responsibility, acting in a way that reflects 
the best of all of us. As President Kennedy 
historically said, “Ask not what your country 
can do for you – ask what you can do for 
your country.”
My fervent hope is that America rolls up its 
sleeves and starts to attack these problems. 
Fixing them would better prepare us for 
future catastrophes, create better economic 
outcomes for everyone (with policies that 
aim to maximize economic growth, driving 
the best potential outcomes), improve 
income inequality, protect the most vulner-
able and foster economic growth that is 
more resilient, which would also strengthen 
America’s role in the world. We must never 
7. We need to come together: My fervent hope for America.
19
DEALING WITH AN EXTRAORDINARY CRISIS
forget that America’s economic prosperity 
is a necessary foundation for our military 
capability, which keeps us free and strong 
and is essential to world peace. These issues 
could all be tackled while preserving the 
freedoms ascribed by our Founding Fathers: 
life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, 
freedom of speech, freedom of religion and 
freedom of enterprise, which means the free 
movement of capital and labor (meaning you 
can work where you want and for whom you 
want). At the end of the day, the pursuit of 
happiness, our freedoms and free enterprise 
are inseparable.
If we acknowledge our problems and work 
together, we can lift up those who need help 
and society as a whole. Business and govern-
ment collaborating together can conquer our 
biggest challenges.
While I have a deep and abiding faith in the United States of America 
and its extraordinary resiliency and capabilities, we do not have  
a divine right to success. Our challenges are significant, and we should 
not assume they will take care of themselves. Let us all do what  
we can to strengthen our exceptional union. 
I would like to express my deep gratitude and appreciation for  
the employees of JPMorgan Chase, and I’d also like to  
thank all of you who shared your good wishes with me while  
I was recuperating from my recent heart surgery. From this letter,  
I hope shareholders and all readers gain an appreciation for 
 the tremendous character and capabilities of our people and how 
they have helped communities around the world. They have  
faced these times of adversity with grace and fortitude. I hope you 
are as proud of them as I am. Finally, the countries and citizens of 
the global community will get through this unprecedented situation, 
undoubtedly stronger for it. Together, we will rise to the challenge.

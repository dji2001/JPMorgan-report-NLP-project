jamie dimon chairman and chief executive officer dear fellow shareholders once again i begin this annual letter to shareholders with a sense of pride about our company and our hundreds of thousands of employees around the worldas i look back on the last decade — a period of profound political and economic change — it is remarkable how much we have accomplished not only in terms of financial performance but in our steadfast dedication to help clients communities and countries all around the worldin  we continued to accelerate investments in products services and technologyfor example for the first time in nearly a decade we extended our presence in several states with new chase branches we plan to open another  new branches in the next few yearsin addition we started a new digital investing platform you invest we launched our partnership with amazon and berkshire hathaway in healthcare we broadened our commitment to create opportunities for jobs and prosperity and reduce the wealth gap for black americans with advancing black pathways announced in february  and we launched our  represents managed revenue  advancingcities initiative to support job and wage growth in communities most in need of capitalwhile it is too soon to assess the impact of these efforts we’re seeing terrific results so far  was another strong year for jpmorganchase with the firm generating record revenue and net income even without the impact of tax reformwe earned  billion in net income on revenue of  billion reflecting strong underlying performance across our businessesadjusting for the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act we now have delivered record results in eight of the last nine years and we have confidence that we will continue to deliver in the futureeach line of business grew revenue and net income for the year while continuing to make significant investments in products people and technologywe grew core loans by  increased deposits in total by  and generally grew market share across our businesses all while maintaining credit discipline and a fortress balance sheetin total we extended credit and raised capital of  trillion for businesses institutional clients and us customersin last year’s letter we emphasized how important a competitive global tax system is for americaover the last  years as the world reduced its tax rates america did notour previous tax code was increasingly uncompetitive overly complex and loaded with special interest provisions that created winners and losersthis drove down capital investment in the united states which reduced domestic productivity and wage growththe new tax code establishes a business tax rate that will make the united states competitive around the world and frees us companies to bring back profits earned overseasthe cumulative effect of capital retained and reinvested over many years in the united states will help cultivate strong businesses and ultimately create jobs and increase wagesfor jpmorganchase all things being equal which they are not the new lower tax rates added  billion to net incomefor the long term we expect that some or eventually most of that increase will be erased as companies compete for customers on products capabilities and priceshowever we did take this opportunity in the short term to massively increase our investments in technology new branches and bankers salaries we now pay a minimum of  a year for full time entrylevel jobs in the united states philanthropy and lending specifically in lower income neighborhoods  tangible book value and average stock

measure of the value we have created for our shareholdersif our asset and liability values are appropriate — and we believe they are — and if we can continue to deploy this capital profitably we think we can continue to exceed  return on tangible equity for the next several years and potentially at or above  in the near term assuming there is not a significant downturnif we can earn these types of returns our company should ultimately be worth considerably more than tangible book valuethe chart on the bottom of the opposite page shows that tangible book value “anchors” the stock pricein the last five years we have bought back almost  billion in stock or approximately  million shares which is nearly  of the company’s common shares outstandingin prior letters i explained why buying back our stock at tangible book value per share was a nobrainerseven years ago we offered an example of this if we bought back a large block of stock at tangible book value earnings and tangible book value per share would be substantially higher just four years later than without the buybackwhile we prefer buying back our stock at tangible book value we think it makes sense to do so even at or above two times tangible book value for reasons similar to those we’ve expressed in the pastif we buy back a big block of stock this year we would expect using analysts’ earnings bank onejpmorganchase  co

enormous responsibility that we have to perform for our shareholdersin the first section of this letter i try to give a comprehensive understanding of how we run our company including how we think about building shareholder value for the long runin that section i highlight our strong belief that building shareholder value can only be done in conjunction with taking care of employees customers and communitiesthis is completely different from the commentary often expressed about the sweeping ills of naked capitalism and institutions only caring about shareholder valuein the second section of this letter i comment on important forwardlooking issueswhile we remain optimistic about the longterm growth of the united states and the world the nearterm economic and political backdrop is increasingly complex and fraught with risks — both known and unknownand we face a future with less overall confidence in virtually all institutions from corporations to governments to the mediathe extremely volatile global markets in the fourth quarter of  might be a harbinger of things to come — creating both risks for our company and opportunities to serve our clientsthe third section of this letter is about public policy specifically american public policy which is a major concern for our country and therefore our companyagain i try to give a comprehensive multiyear overview of what i see as some of our problems and suggest a few ways they can be addressedone consistent theme is completely clear businesses governments and communities need to work as partners collaboratively and

business from the point of view of the customerijpmorganchase principles and strategies customer needs are what gets our attentionwe believe that in a hypercompetitive world from competitors known and unknown the best strategy – both offensive and defensive – is to give the customer more something better faster or more efficientlywe are always on a quest to improve our products and services and for the most part this is done with enhancements in technology and through the continual training of our peoplemost fundamental of all is doing the right thing for our customers – in all caseswe energetically drive organic growthwe continue to drive good and healthy organic growth meaning good customers products and services they need and want at fair and reasonable prices and while we are happy with our progress we recog nize that we won’t meet every goal we set for ourselves and can always do betterin past letters we have identified many areas of organic growthour achievements with these initiatives are detailed in the ceo letters in this annual report but a few of the critical strategies are highlighted in the sidebar beloworganic growth opportunities across our lines of

never lose sight of the fact that we have an extraordinary number of strong competitors – we cannot be complacentthere are many capable financial tech nology fintech companies in the united states and

incredibly wellcapitalized bank with enormous liquiditybut a fortress balance sheet isn’t enoughto be a fortress company we believe that you also need to have strong properly diver sified earnings and marginsit is capital and liquidity combined with strong earn ings and margins that provide the ability to withstand extreme stressi want to remind shareholders that we run hundreds of stress tests internally each month some of which are far more severe than the federal reserve’s the fed annual stress testwe also believe that we should have strong earnings after making investments for the future – which may reduce earnings in the short runwe are cost and capitalefficient we rigorously allocate our capital and we continually analyze our businesses both to maximize their individual performance and to make sure they are contributing to the health of the whole companywe like to use our capital to growwe much prefer to use our capital to grow than to buy back stockwe believe buying back stock should be considered only when either we cannot invest sometimes as a result of regulatory policies or we are gener ating excess capital that we do not expect to use in the next few yearsbuybacks should not be done at the expense of investing appropriately in our companyinvesting for the future should come first and at jpmorganchase it doeshowever when you cannot see a clear use for your excess capital over the short term buying back stock is an important capital tool – as long as you are buying it back at a reasonable priceand when companies buy back stock which we only do when it is at a price that we think adds value to our remaining shareholders the capital is redis tributed to investors who can put it to good use elsewhereit does not disappearwe currently have excess capital but we hope in the future to be able to invest more of it to grow our businessesgood financial management is also criticalwe have always believed that a deep and detailed understanding of a company’s finan cial and operational statements including all assets and liabilities and all revenue and expenses without netting and regardless of whether they are on or offbalance sheet is critical to running a safe and sound organi zationhowever accounting and therefore earnings is not a perfect measure of perfor mance or economicsi would like to discuss a few reasons why • accounting rules can be counterintuitive but you can’t make business decisions based on themwhile we are rigorous about proper accounting and disclosure some times accounting can distort the actual economics of a businessa few examples will sufficein credit card accounting for instance new card customer costs are expensed over the course of a year and inexplicably as a contrarevenue item ie as a reduction of revenue rather than an expensein addition under upcoming accounting rules losses that are expected over the life of the card balance are accounted for upfrontmeanwhile the earnings from the card are booked over the life of the card which averages approximately seven yearsin connection with mortgage loans we don’t own but instead service ie by sending statements and receiving payments on behalf of the mortgagor the accounting standard requires that we presentvalue expected revenue and expenses and book every thing upfrontbut in cash management asset management and many other prod ucts that have a similar somewhat predict able annuitylike revenue stream the prac tice is differentthe reason i am making this point is that you need to understand the economics of decisionsaccounting can easily make people do silly things  ijpmorganchase principles and strategies • conservative accounting is betterwhile we always try to make intelligent economic decisions i do believe that appropriately conservative accounting is a better way to manage your businessfor example recog nize problems early write off software that is not valuable don’t book revenue that is uncertain and so onaggressive accounting leads to trouble and while it may help increase performance measures in the short run it will most certainly be uncovered and reversed at precisely the wrong time • earnings guidance can be very damaginglet’s be very clear transparency with shareholders proper disclosures and guidance on certain revenue expense and balance sheet items all are goodhowever earnings themselves in any one quarter are a function of decisions made over many many yearsquarterly earn ings are dependent upon many factors like cost of goods sold and market prices which often change as well as unex pected events the weather and wage and gross domestic product gdp growthno ceo can predict all of those things and any analyst with an earnings estimate has made his or her own specific assump tions around themthe real damage to an organization comes from the cumulative corrosive ness of trying to “make” its numbersthis can be exacerbated by compen sation deals and models that can be manipulated to change quarterly resultsit’s easy to change earnings in a quarter by doing stupid things that help earn ings in the short term but are bad in the long termexamples include asking customers to inappropriately buy more products before the end of the quarter so you can show revenue growth reducing marketing not opening that new branch or not investing in technology that won’t have a payback for a year or twoi could go on and onand this could spiral within a company as loyal wellmeaning employees do what they can to help a company meet its “earnings goal” importantly in the next section i speak in detail about responsible banking client selection and intensive risk managementproper management is as critical as anything else we do but i did not want to repeat the messages herewe lift up our communitieswe will never forget that the most important thing we do is to run a healthy and vibrant company that is here to constantly serve our clients with responsible bankingbut we want our shareholders and all of our constit uents to understand the tremendous amount we do in addition to traditional banking to help the communities in which we operateour effort is substantial permanent and supported by the whole companyone of the reasons for jpmorganchase’s enduring success is we have always recog nized that longterm business success depends on community successwhen everyone has a fair shot at participating in and sharing in the rewards of growth the economy will be stronger and our society will be betterwe are making significant longterm datadriven business and philan thropic investments aimed at opening doors to opportunity for those being left behindmost people consider corporate responsi bility to be enhanced philanthropywhile we are devoted to philanthropy we are on our way to spending  million a year on these efforts corporate responsibility is far more than just thatwe finance more than  billion in affordable housing each  ijpmorganchase principles and strategies year we do extensive lending in low and moderateincome neighborhoods we lend to and finance small businesses around the country and we design products and services in financial education for lower income individualsand importantly these efforts are supported by senior leadership managed by some of our best people these efforts are not an afterthought and are sustainablewe try to be creative but we analyze everything including philanthropy based on expected resultswe are huge supporters of regional and community banks which are critical to many cities and small towns around the countryin an oped published by the wall street journal in  i wrote “in this system regional and smaller community banks play an indispensable rolethey sit close to the communities they serve their highest ranking corporate officers live in the same neighborhoods as their clientsthey are able to forge deep and longstanding relation ships and bring a keen knowledge of the local economy and culturethey frequently are able to provide hightouch and special ized banking services” jpmorganchase as a traditional “money center bank” and “bankers’ bank” in fact is the largest banker in america to regional and community bankswe bank approximately  of america’s  regional and community banksin  we made loans to them or raised capital for them totaling  billionin addition we process payments for them we finance some of their mortgage activities we advise them on acquisitions and we buy and sell securities for themwe also provide them with interest rate swaps and foreign exchange both for themselves – to help them hedge some of their exposures – and for their clientsover the past five years we have developed and refined a model that may be a blue print for urban revitalization and inclusive growthour head of corporate responsi bility describes our significant measures in more detail in his letter but i highlight a few examples here including the sidebar on page  that describes our focused effort to support black advancement in a number of the communities we serve • detroit exemplifies the challenges many cities wrestle with as well as the strategies for solving themsince  jpmorganchase has been combining its philanthropy and business expertise to address some of detroit’s biggest economic hurdles ranging from catalyzing development building infrastructure and affordable housing and boosting small business growth to revitalizing education and preparing detroiters with the skills to secure wellpaying jobswe are deeply proud of our  million commitment and the impact we have made to date – the city has been the proving ground for our model for driving inclusive growth which has made a real difference in detroit’s comeback and the lives of its citizensover the past five years we have taken lessons learned and applied them to other cities facing similar challenges • the entrepreneurs of color fund eocf is another example of how we are turning our insights into actionin  jpmorganchase helped launch the entrepreneurs of color fund in detroit to provide under served entrepreneurs with access to capital and assistance needed to grow and thrivefrom  to  the fund made or approved loans totaling  million to  minority small businesses resulting in over  new or preserved jobssince then the detroit fund has more than tripled in size to over

annual letter to shareholders i always enjoy sharing what we have learned about management leader ship and organizations over timegreat management is critical though true leadership requires morefor any large organization great manage ment is critical to its longterm successgreat management is disciplined and rigorousfacts analysis detail … facts analysis detail … repeatyou can never do enough and it does not endcomplex activity requires hard work and not guessingtest test test and learn learn learnand accept failure as a “normal” recurring outcomedevelop great models but know that they are

and the appro priate followup – all to get to the right deci sionforce urgency and kill complacencyknow that there is competition everywhere all the timebut even if you do all of this well it is not enough  ijpmorganchase principles and strategies real leadership requires heart and humilityit’s possible to be very good at the type of management described above but as managers rise in an organization they depend on others more and morethe team is increasingly important – many team members know more than their managers do about certain issues – a team working together can get to a better outcomei have seen many senior managers ascend into big new roles with a bad reaction to their increasing dependence on other people – by hoarding information never allowing them selves to be embarrassed and demanding personal loyalty versus loyalty to the orga nization and its principlesthey don’t grow into the new job – they swell into iti have often felt that dependency on their teams makes these folks feel paranoid or insecure – leading to this bad behaviorgood leaders have the humility to know that they don’t know everythingthey foster an environment of openness and sharingthey earn trust and respectthere are no “friends of the boss” – everyone gets equal treatmentthe door is universally open to everybodysince we shared issues that are high priori ties it is almost as important to describe the issues we don’t worry about daily – and whya few are listed below • we do not worry about the stock price in the short runif you continue to build a great company the stock price will take care of itself • we do not worry about quarterly earningsbuild the company for the future and you will maximize earnings over the long run • while we worry extensively about all of the risks we bear we essentially do not worry about things like fluctuating markets and shortterm economic reportswe simply manage through themeveryone knows that these leaders are only trying to do the right thing for customers and clientsthey share the credit when things go well and take the blame when it does notand true leaders don’t just show they care – they actually do carewhile they demand hard work and effort they work as hard as anyone and they have deep empathy for their employees under any type of stressthey are patriots not mercenaries they have the heart to wear the jersey every dayyou need to stay hungry and scrappycompetition is everywhere but often very successful companies are lulled into a false sense of securityhaving worked at a number of companies not nearly as successful as ours i have to confess that i kind of liked being the underdog we fought every day to even try to get to the major leaguesall companies are subject to inertia insipid bureaucracy and other flaws which must be eradicatedif a company isn’t staying on edge maintaining a fire in its belly and pushing forward it will eventually failwe do not worry about some issues • we do not worry about loan growthit is most definitely an outcome of how we manage credit and client decisionswe will not stretch ever to show growth in loans • while we fanatically manage our company we do not worry about missing revenue or expense budgets for good reasonsthis is not a mixed messagewe want our leaders to do the right thing for the long term and explain it if they have good reasons to diverge from prior plans • we do not worry about chargeoffs increasing in a recession – we fully expect it and we manage our business knowing there will be good times and bad timessuffice it to say we stay devoted to these principles  in this section i review and analyze some of the current critical issues that affect our companyan enormous amount has been accomplished in the last decadethe strength stability and resiliency of the financial system have been fundamentally improved over the course of the last  yearswhile i don’t agree with all of the wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank regulations the bill did give regulators needed authority to fix our financial system’s most critical flawsthese postcrisis reforms have made banks much safer and sounder in the three most important areas capital liquidity and resolution and recoverylarge banks defined as global systemically important financial institutions have more than doubled their highest quality capital to protect against losses and they have tripled their liquid assets to total assets ratio to protect against unexpected net cash outflowsthis allows healthy banks to weather extreme stress while continuing to provide credit and support to their clients see message to employees on iicomments on current critical issues pages  that describes many of the lessons learned from the crisis and the extensive steps we took to help our clientshere’s an eyeopening example of how much capital is now in the system under the fed’s most extreme stresstesting scenario where  of the largest american banks bear extreme losses as if each were the worst bank in the system the combined losses are about  of the total loss absorbing resources of those  banksjpmorganchase alone has nearly three times the loss absorbing resources to cover the projected losses of all of these  banks see chart belowin addition resolution and recovery regu lations have given regulators both the legal authority and the tools to manage a failing or

preferred stock and tlac longterm debt tangible common equity  looking back on the financial crisis dear colleagues a decade has passed since the collapse of lehman brothers so now is a good time to reflect on the financial crisis that was raging  years ago this montha lot has been written — and far more is still to be written — on this crisis but i would like to share a few thoughts with you on that extraordinary period of time and everything that all of you at jpmorganchase did to try to helpthe gathering storm hit with a vengeancewhile the collapse of lehman in september  was the epicenter of the crisis it was actually far more complex than that — the roots go back to beforeby late  we already saw problems in subprime mortgages leveraged lending and quantitative investingwith the onset of basel ii leverage at investment banks not commercial banks more than doubled as did shadow banking think structured investment vehicles collateralized debt obligations money market funds and so onthis was often funded by unsecured undependable shortterm wholesale borrowingthen the biggest problem of all presented itself it was not just subprime mortgages that were flawed — but all mortgagesthis happened in hind sight by bad underwriting government policy that fueled and fostered inappropriate mortgage lending higher and higher loantovalues less and less cash down weaker appraisals and insufficient income certification unscrupulous brokers and cavalier investorsthe banks though not the worst actors in mortgages joined the party toowhen the world realized that  trillion would ultimately be lost in mortgages panic ensuedthere were multiple failures — mortgage brokers savings and loans sl including washington mutual wamu and indymac as well as fannie mae and freddie mac which were the largest financial failures of all time — culminating in the dramatic failure of lehman followed by the extraordinary bailouts of aig and other major financial institutionsjpmorganchase did everything it possibly could do to help during this timeon march   we announced our acquisition of bear stearns a company with  billion of assets which had collapsed and had fatal problems we were essentially buying a house … but it was a house on fireand we did this at the request of the us government thinking at the time that this could help head off a terrible crisison september    days after the collapse of lehman brothers we bought the largest sl — wamu — another company that had  billion of assetswe took other extraordinary actions — often at calculated but great risk to jpmorganchase — to support clients including governments and to support the markets in generalwe loaned  billion in the global interbank market when it was needed mostwith markets in complete turmoil we were the only bank willing to singlehandedly lend  billion to the state of california  billion to the state of new jersey and  billion to the state of illinoisadditionally — and frequently — we loaned or raised for our clients  trillion at consistent and fair rates in many cases far below what the market would have demanded and we provided more than  billion to local govern ments municipalities schools hospitals and notforprofits over the course ofmany other banks did the sameyou probably will be surprised to find out that we lent a tremendous amount of money to lehman before the crisis — and even more after the crisisin fact at the request of the federal reserve we took extraordinary risk to lend more than  billion on a secured basis to lehman after its bankruptcy to help facilitate sales of assets in as orderly a way as possible to minimize disruption in the marketsseptember  message to employees  years after the financial crisis  this was a traumatic historic period of time not just for the financial system but for the world as a wholewe endured a onceinageneration economic political and social storm and because of you we have emerged  years after this crisis as a company of which we can all be proudthe aftermath and lessons learnedmany people still ask me about the troubled asset relief program tarp a government program that provided funding to banks in the midst of the crisisjpmorganchase did not want or need tarp money but we recognized that if the healthy banks did not take it no one else could — out of fear that the market would lose confidence in themand while it helped create the false rallying cry that all the banks needed support the government both the federal reserve and the treasury was trying everything it could in addition to tarpand the federal reserve and the treasury should be congratulated for the extraordinary actions they took to stave off a far worse crisisin hindsight it is easy to criticize any specific action but in total the government succeeded in avoiding a calamitythere were many lessons learned from the crisis the need for plenty of capital and liquidity proper underwriting and regulations that are constantly refined fair and appropriatein fact regulators should take a victory lap because lehman bear stearns aig and multiple other failures effectively could not happen today because of the new rules and requirementswe entered the crisis with the capital liquidity earnings diversity of businesses people and a risk management culture that enabled us to avoid most — but unfortunately not all — of the issues exposed by the crisisthese strengths also helped us to weather the economic crisis and to continue to play a central role in supporting our clients and our communities and rebuilding the us economycounter to what most people think many of the extreme actions we took were not done to make a profit they were done to support our country and the financial systemwhat stood out most was our character and capabilities — which make jpmorganchase what it is todaywhen the global financial crisis unfolded in  the people of jpmorganchase understood the vital role our firm needed to play and felt a deep responsibility to those who rely on usit was this sense of respon sibility that enabled us to move beyond the challenges we were facing at that time and maintain a focus on what really matters taking care of our clients helping the communities in which we operate — all while under extreme pressure from both the markets and the body politic — and protecting our companyhow we managed through the crisis is a testimony to the collective strength of character and commitment of our peopleduring those chaotic days throughout the crisis and its aftermath many of our people had to work around the clock seven days a week for months on endand they did it without complaintthe biggest lesson of the crisis the quality character culture and capabilities of your partners are paramountlooking back and then looking around at the company we are today i am filled with awe and admirationfor jpmorganchase these past  years have been part of a challenging yet defining decadetoday jpmorganchase is among the leaders in most of our businessesi can’t tell you how proud i am to be your partner and to witness your extraordinary performancei can’t thank our current and former employees enough for helping us get through those turbulent times and for the company we have become  iicomments on current critical issueswe have to remind ourselves that responsible banking is good and safe bankingone of the critical responsibilities of banks is to take a rigorous and disciplined approach to allocating capital in the financial system – whether they do it directly through loans or through public and private capital marketsbanks need to do this knowing there will be recessions and that they should plan to support their clients through their most diffi cult timeswe did exactly that throughout the  crisis again see message to employees on pageswhile many people focus on market making which of course entails risk we buy and sell about  trillion a day of various securities around the world this risk taking is carefully moni tored and largely hedgedto put risk taking and market making a little bit in perspective – in the last five years we have lost money trading on only  days and the loss was usually small and never more than about two times the average normal trading day revenueoverall loans are still the biggest risk that banks takeour loan losses last year were  billion and in the worst year of the great recession our loan losses were approx imately  billionresponsible banks cannot always give customers what they wantmaking bad and unworthy loans ultimately is bad for both the bank and the customerbeing a responsible bank means you can’t always give customers what they want and therefore it is unlikely that all of your customers are going to like youwe are fundamentally not in the same position as most businessesif a customer has the money most businesses will sell their goods and services to that customerbanks can’t do thatsometimes we have to say no or enforce lehman redux — it simply would not have failed but it would have been easily manageable if it did fail as i mentioned in my shareholder letter in  it is instructive to look at what would happen if lehman were to fail in today’s regulatory regimefirst of all it is highly unlikely the firm would fail because under today’s capital rules lehman’s equity capital would be approximately  billion instead of  billion which it was inin addition lehman would have far stronger liquidity and “bailinable” debtand finally the firm would be forced to raise capital much earlier in the processlehman simply would not have failedhowever if by the remotest shootingstar possibility lehman failed anyway regulators would now have the legal authority to put the firm in receivership they did not have that ability back inat the moment of failure unsecured debt of approximately  billion would be immediately converted to equity “new lehman” would be the bestcapitalized bank in the worldin addition derivatives contracts would not be triggered and cash would continue to move through the pipes of the financial systemlegislators and regulators should be applauded for what they have done to solve the too big to fail problem though i should point out that this was accomplished by putting some basic rules in place — not the thousands of other rules layered atop them  iicomments on current critical issues rules that may be unpopulari have always believed that this necessary discipline with customers is one of the reasons that histori cally banks have not been popularbanks are under constant pressure including political pressure to make loans remember subprime mortgages even when they should notbut when and if something goes wrong with loans even when proper and responsible underwriting is done banks will come under a lot of legal regulatory and political scrutiny and should expect to be blamed for potentially causing the problemthese conflicting pressures – to make or not make loans – will always exist and need to be properly navigated by a good bankclient selection is criticalclient selection is one of the most important things we doif one bank builds a book of business with clients of high character and another bank builds its business with clients of low character who are usually pushing sound banking practices to the limit it’s clear which bank will succeed over timetherefore turning down clients which can sometimes be hard to do is often the only way to be a responsible bankrisk taking is a detailed analytical process and includes extensive risk mitigationshareholders may be surprised to find out that fundamentally we are not a risktaking but rather a riskmitigating institutionrisk mitigation is not guessing – it is a thoughtful detailed analytical process that leads to measured decision makingpartic ipants in our risk meetings can attest that while we are adamant about serving clients we are also fanatic about understanding and mitigating some of the associated risksso in addition to proper client selection risks are mitigated through simplification diver sification hedging syndication covenants hard limits continuous monitoring and fast reaction to problemswe deeply analyze everything so we can shoulder appropriate risk for and with our clientswe are their financial partnera recent example in the oil and gas sector shows how we balance risk while serving clients in tough timesfrom  to  oil prices collapsed from a high of  per barrel to a low of  per barrelwe were carrying approximately  loans to smaller oil and gas companies mostly based in houston referred to in the industry as “reservebased loans” or rblsthe proven oil and gas reserves in the ground served as the collateral for these loans as reviewed by both jpmorgan’s petroleum engineers and thirdparty engi neering consultantswe had  billion in outstanding loans under the rbl structure and more to the oil industry as a wholewhile we made these loans conservatively we knew that low oil prices at the bottom of the cycle put us at great risk of loan losses – maybe even as high as  millionour view was that we were going to work with these borrowers ie extend the loans and try to help the companies survive this rough patch of course we put up additional loan loss reserves to account for possible losses at one point surprisingly some regulators made it clear that they did not want banks to extend these loans because they were too riskybut we thought it was important even at the risk of losing hundreds of millions of dollars something that we were posi tioned to be able to do to help our clients get through this tough time rather than desert them when they needed us mostand sticking with our clients is exactly what we didwe thought regulators were overreacting – and indeed our losses ultimately were minisculebecause of these actions we are still welcome in houston  iicomments on current critical issueswe believe in good regulation — both to help america grow and improve financial stabilityi want to be very clear that we do not advo cate for the repeal of doddfrankwe believe that the strength and resilience of the us financial system have benefited from the lawten years out from the crisis however it is appropriate for policymakers to examine areas of our regulatory framework that are excessive overlapping inefficient or duplicativeat the same time they should identify areas where banks can promote economic growth without impacting the very important progress we have made on safety and soundnessin fact a stronger economy by definition is a safer economyour goal should be to achieve a rational calibrated approach to regulation that strikes the right balancethis should be an ongoing and rigorous process that does not require any significant piece of legislation and should not be politicizedhere are a few areas where we think recalibra tion would be good not only for banks but for consumers and the economy as a whole • carefully monitor the growing shadow bank systemwhile we do not believe that the rise in nonbanks and shadow banking has reached the point of systemic risk the growth in nonbank mortgage lending student lending leveraged lending and some consumer lending is accelerating and needs to be assiduously monitored we do this monitoring regularly as part of our own business growth in shadow banking has been possible because rules and regulations imposed upon banks are not necessarily imposed upon these nonbank lenders which exemplifies the risk of not having the new rules prop erly calibratedan additional risk is that many of these nonbank lenders will not be able to continue lending in difficult economic times – their borrowers will become strandedbanks traditionally try to continue lending to their customers in tough times • the country desperately needs mortgage reform — it would add to america’s economic growthreducing onerous and unneces sary origination and servicing require ments there are  federal and state requirements today and opening up the securitization markets for safe loans would dramatically improve the cost and avail ability of mortgages to consumers – partic ularly the young the selfemployed and those with prior defaultsand these would not be subprime mortgages but mortgages that we should be makingby taking this step our economists believe that home ownership and economic growth would increase by up to  a yearin the early s bad mortgage laws helped create the great recession oftoday bad mortgage rules are hindering the healthy growth of the us economybecause there are so many regulators involved in crafting the new rules coupled with political intervention that isn’t always helpful it is hard to achieve the muchneeded mortgage reformthis has become a critical issue and one reason why banks have been moving away from significant parts of the mortgage busi nessthat business in particular high lights one of the flaws of our complicated capital allocation regimethe best way to risk manage a bank is to use risk weights that are actually based on riskhowever since most banks are also constrained by standardized capital a capital measure that does not riskadjust for the lower risk of having a properly underwritten prime mortgage owning mortgages becomes hugely unprofitablebecause of these significant issues we are intensely reviewing our role in origi nating servicing and holding mortgagesthe odds are increasing that we will need to materially change our mortgage strategy going forward  iicomments on current critical issues we also need to get the recalibration of other regulatory requirements right partic ularly around operational risk capital the fed’s comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar stress test and the addi tional allocation of capital to global system ically important banks gsibif we don’t do so certain products and services will continue to be pushed outside the banking system where they are fundamentally not regulated distorting markets and raising the cost of credit for clients • operational risk capitalwe now hold nearly  billion of operational risk weighted assets which means we hold more than  billion of equity for assets that don’t existthis was a new calcula tion added after the crisis to recognize that banks also bear serious operational risk stemming from lawsuits processing errors and other issuesi agree that all banks bear operational risk yet this is also true for all companiesmost compa nies including banks have earnings to pay for operational riskand the calcu lation that gets us to  billion is questionable and so complex that i am not going to explain it herefinally most of our operational risk assets stem from bear stearns and wamu subprime mort gage products that we don’t even offer anymoretying up capital in perpetuity – looking for shadows on the wall – is probably not the best idea for fostering growth in america • comprehensive capital analysis reviewi deeply believe in stress testing but i do have issues with ccarfirst it consists of only a single test there are many things that can go wrong that should be stress tested – which is unlikely to prepare anyone banks or regulators adequatelythere is an arbitrariness to a single testmoreover i don’t think ccar accurately represents what a loss would look like in the nine quarters after a lehmantype event remember that in the nine quarters following the actual lehman collapse jpmorganchase earned  billionone of the refrains that we hear about ccar results is they show that most banks at the worst part of the stress cycle can barely cover their required capitalthis is fundamentally inaccuratethe ccar test can give this false impression because it requires banks to do unnatural things such as continuing all stock buybacks – even when it is completely obvious that banks wouldn’t or couldn’t do thisas a result we don’t rely solely on ccar and we stress test hundreds of scenarios a month preparing ourselves for circum stances far worse than ccar stresswhile ccar losses may exceed what banks are likely to experience they do appropriately include benefits that banks receive from being diversified and from having healthy profit marginsand ccar is an effective builtin countercy clical buffer because its whole purpose is to ensure adequate capital at the worst point of a major stress eventcapital requirements for gsibs however are completely different • gsib capital requirementsmy biggest issue is with gsib capital require ments and since they may be added to the ccar stress test they become even more importantmost of the factors used in gsib requirements are not riskadjusted – and many of the calculations have no fundamental underpinning or logical justificationtheir methodology irrationally multi plies certain factors over and over and many of the facts are simply unjus tified on any basisfor example one of the risks is called “substitutability” which is supposed to measure the risk that we won’t be able to replace certain services of a large bank that fails or retrenches during a crisisthe specific factors used to calculate this risk are market share of equity and debt under writing and market makingbut when  iicomments on current critical issues lehman failed no one had a problem in replacing any of these activitiesfor another example american regu lators simply doubled thresholds for american banks versus international competition and have never adjusted them as they were supposed to do for economic growth for other new regula tions like total loss absorbing capacity and liquidity or for the fact that gsib banks have become a smaller part of the financial systemnow regulators are talking about adding gsib require ments to ccar which is only logical if the gsib charge itself makes sense in the first placeif gsib regulation is to become this important it needs thor ough justificationlater in this letter i discuss some possible adverse consequences to the us financial system because of the interplay between these factors in a downturnone comment that we continue to hear is that us banks are now doing quite well despite evidence that gsib requirements are tougher on us banks than on foreign banksbut that outperformance is not ordained from above and may not always be the casewe should calculate data the right way and us banks their employees shareholders and the communities they serve should not be put at a permanent disadvantageproper calibration of financial regulation can enhance the growth and resiliency of the us economy which actually reduces systemic risk and helps banks safely serve more clientswe believe stock buybacks are an essential part of proper capital allocation but secondary to longterm investingi have already noted that stock buybacks though sometimes misused are an important tool that businesses must have to reallocate excess capitalto reiterate this should be done only after proper invest ments for the future have been considereda recent complaint is that companies partially due to tax reform have used their excess capital to buy back more stock instead of investing in their busi nesswhile this is true you should keep in mind three thingsfirst as stock buybacks increased in  so did corporate capital expenditures and research and develop ment rdin fact contrary to popular belief capital expenditures as a percentage of gdp are higher today than in the “good old days” of the s and ssecond companies tend to buy back stock when they don’t see a good use for capital in the next year or twowe believe that as compa nies adjust to the new higher cash flows they will begin to reinvest more of that money in the united statesthe benefit of tax reform is the longterm multiyear cumulative effect of capital retained and reinvested in the united statesand third the capital that was used to buy back stock did not disappear – it was given to share holders who then put it to a better and higher use of their own choosinghere is one concluding comment on long term investing many investors legiti mately demand that companies think long term and explain their strategies and poli ciesmeanwhile these same investors who demand longterm thinking from compa nies often invest in funds that are paid a lot of money for how a stock performs in one yeari hope these investors appreciate the disconnect and hope they will consider the pressures for shortterm performance they may have helped to create  iicomments on current critical issueson the importance of the cloud and artificial intelligence we are all inthe power of the cloud is realwe were a little slow in adopting the cloud for which i am partially responsiblemy early thinking about the cloud was that it was just another term for outsourcingi held firm to the view which is somewhat still true that we can run our own data centers networks and applications as efficiently as anyonebut here’s the critical point cloud capabilities are far more extensive and we are now full speed aheadlet me cite a couple of examples • the cloud gives us the ability to achieve rapid scale and elasticity of computing power exponentially beyond our own capacitythis will be especially relevant as we scale up our artificial intelligence efforts • the cloud platform is agile and flexibleit offers access to data sets advanced analytics and machine learning capabili ties beyond our ownit increases devel opers’ effectiveness by multiples – you can almost “click and drop” new elements into existing programs as opposed to writing extensive new codefor instance adding databases andor machine learning to an application can be done almost instantaneouslyand certain tasks such as testing code and provi sioning compute power are automated • the cloud provides a software develop ment experience that is frictionless and allows our engineers to prototype quickly and learn fast as well as increase the speed of delivering new capabilities to our customers and clientsit is important to note that the cloud has matured to the point where it can meet the high expectations that are set by large enter prises that have fairly intense demands around security audit procedures access to systems cyber security and business resiliencywe will be rapidly “refactoring” most of our applications to take full advantage of cloud computingwe then can decide whether it is more advantageous to run our applications on the external cloud or the internal cloud the internal cloud will have many of the benefits of the external cloud’s scalable and efficient platformsone final but key issue agile platforms and cloud capabilities not only allow you to do things much faster but also enable you to organize teams differentlyyou can create smaller teams of five to  people who can be continually reimagining reinventing and rolling out new products and services in a few days instead of monthsthe power of artificial intelligence and machine learning is realthese technologies already are helping us reduce risk and fraud upgrade customer service improve underwriting and enhance marketing across the firmand this is just the beginningas our management teams get better at understanding the power of ai and machine learning these tools are rapidly being deployed across virtually everything we dowe can also use artificial intelligence to try to achieve certain desired outcomes such as making mortgages even more available to minoritiesa few examples will suffice • in the corporate  investment bank deepx leverages machine learning to assist our equities algorithms globally to execute transactions across  stocks a day and this total is rising as we roll out deepx to new countries • across our company we will be deploying virtual assistants robots driven by artifi cial intelligence to handle tasks such as maintaining internal help desks tracking down errors and routing inquiries • in consumer marketing we are better able to customize insights and offerings for individual customers based on for example their ability to save or invest their travel preferences or the availability of discounts on brands they like • technological solutions help us do better underwriting expediting the mortgage or automobile loan approval process letting  iicomments on current critical issues the customer accept the loan in a couple of clicks and then start shopping for a home or car • in our consumer operations we are using ai and machine learning techniques for atm cash management to optimize cash in devices reduce the cost of reloads and schedule atm maintenance • and our initial results from machine learning fraud applications are expected to drive approximately  million of annual benefits and countless efficienciesfor example machine learning is helping to deliver a better customer experience while also prioritizing safety at the point of sale where fraud losses have been reduced significantly with automated decisions on transactions made in millisecondswe are now able to approve  million additional good customers who would have been declined for potential fraud and also decline approximately  million additional fraudsters who would have been approvedmachine learning will also curtail check fraud losses by analyzing signatures payee names and check features in real time • over time ai will also dramatically improve antimoney launderingbank secrecy act protocols and processes as well as other complex compliance requirementswe will try to retrain and redeploy our workforce as ai reduces certain types of jobswe are evaluating all of our jobs to deter mine which are most susceptible to being lost through aiwe will plan ahead so we can retrain or deploy our employees both for other roles inside the company and if necessary outside the companythe combined power of virtually unlimited computing strength ai applied to almost anything and the ability to use vast sets of data and rapidly change applications is extraordinary – we have only begun to take advantage of the opportunities for the company and for our customerswe remain devoted and diligent to protect privacy and stay cyber safe — we will do what it takesthe threat of cyber security may very well be the biggest threat to the us financial systemi have written in previous letters about the enormous effort and resources we dedi cate to protect ourselves and our clients – we spend nearly  million a year on these efforts and have more than  employees deployed to this mission in some wayindirectly we also spend a lot of time and effort trying to protect our company in different ways as part of the ordinary course of running the businessbut the financial system is interconnected and adversaries are smart and relentless – so we must continue to be vigilantthe good news is that the industry plus many other industries along with the full power of the federal govern ment is increasingly being mobilized to combat this threatthe issues around privacy are realwe have spoken frequently in the past about the importance of safeguarding the privacy of our customerswe already do this exten sively and in fact we are inventing new products to make it easier for our customers to understand where we send their data with their permission as well as how to change or restrict what we do with that datanew laws in europe stipulate that consumers should be able to see what data companies have on file about them and to correct or delete this information if they choosethese are the right principles but they are very complex to executeit is imperative that the us government thoughtfully design policies to protect its consumers and that these poli cies be national versus statespecificdifferent  iicomments on current critical issues state laws around privacy rules would create a virtually impossible legal compliance and regulatorymonitoring situationbut maybe the most crucial privacy issue of all relates to protecting our democracyour first amendment rights do not extend to foreign governments entities or individualsthe openness of the internet means that trolls foreign governments and others are aggressively using social media and other platforms to confuse and distort informationthey should not be allowed to secretly or dishonestly advertise or even promote ideas on media and social networkswe believe there are ways to address this and we will be talking more about this issue in the futurewe know there are risks on the horizon that will eventually demand our attentionin spite of all the uncertainty the us economy continues to grow in  albeit more slowly than inemployment and wages are going up inflation is moderate financial markets are healthy and consumer and business confidence remains strong although down from alltime highsthe consumer balance sheet and credit are in rather good shape and housing though not particularly strong is in short supply in many us cities which should eventually be a tailwindbefore i review some of the serious and possibly increasing risks that we may confront in the years ahead i do want to review what happened in the fourth quarter ofthe fourth quarter of  might be a harbinger of things to comegoing into the final months of last year opti mism about the global economy prevailed and this was reflected in the stock and bond marketsbut in the fourth quarter growth slowed in germany italy repudiated european union rules brexit uncertainty remained and fear spiked around ameri ca’s trade issues with chinaamong other geopolitical tensions the us government shutdown beganin addition more questions arose about interest rate increases in the united states and the effect of the reversal of unprecedented quantitative easing partic ularly in this countrythese issues which reduced growth forecasts and increased uncertainty should legitimately cause stock prices to drop and bond spreads to increasehowever stock markets fell  investment grade bond spreads gapped out by  and certain markets like initial public offerings and high yield virtually closed downeven at the time these large swings seemed to be an overreaction but they highlight two critical issuesone which we never forget is that investor sentiment can veer widely from optimism to pessimism based on little funda mental changeand second for the fourth or fifth time in this recovery there were excessive moves in the market with rapidly increasing volatility accompanied by steep drops in liquiditymarket reactions do not always accurately reflect the real economy and therefore poli cymakers and even companies should not overreact to thembut they do reflect market participant views of changing probabilities and possibilities of economic outcomesthus policymakers and banks particularly the fed must necessarily because they need to think forward take an assessment of these issues into accountwith this backdrop i will discuss some of the serious issues on people’s minds with more on liquidity laterthere are legitimate concerns around china’s economy in addition to trade but they are manageableto fully understand china you have to do a fair assessment of all of its strengths and weaknessesover the last  years china has done a highly effective job of getting itself to this point of economic development but in the next  years the country will have to confront serious issuesthe chinese lack enough food water and energy corruption continues to be a problem stateowned  iicomments on current critical issues enterprises are often inefficient corporate and government debt levels are growing rapidly financial markets lack depth trans parency and adequate rule of law and asia is a very complex part of the world geopoliti cally speakingjust as important not enough people participate in the nation’s political systemchinese leadership is well aware of these issues and talks about many of them quite openlyi say none of this to be nega tive about china indeed i have enormous respect for what the chinese have accom plished in the economic realm but just to give a balanced viewand in spite of these difficulties we believe that china is well on its way to becoming a fully developed nation though the future will probably entail more uncertainty and moments of slower growth like the rest of us than in the pastdisruption of trade is another risk for chinathe united states’ trade issues with china are substantial and realthey include the theft or forced transfer of intellectual property lack of bilateral investment rights giving ownership or control of investments onerous nontariff barriers unfair subsidies or benefits for stateowned enterprises and the lack of rapid enforcement of any disagree mentsthe us position is supported though in an uncoordinated way by our japanese and european allieswe should only expect china to do what is in its own selfinterest but we believe that it should and will agree to some of the united states’ trade demands because ultimately the changes will create a stronger chinese economywe should also point out that over the last  years the chinese have been on a highspeed path that includes increasing transparency and economic reform and while the momentum slows down periodically they have continued relentlessly on that pathwe believe the odds are high that a fair trade deal will eventually be worked out – but if not there could be serious repercussionschina can deal with many serious situa tions because unlike developed democratic nations it can both macromanage and micromanage its economy and move very fastgovernment officials can pull in a coor dinated way fiscal monetary and industrial policy levers to maintain the growth and employment they want and they have the control and wherewithal to do itthat being said the american public should understand that china does not have a straight road to becoming the dominant economic powerthe nation simply has too much to overcome in the foreseeable futureif china and the united states can maintain a healthy strategic and economic relationship and that should be our goal it could greatly benefit both countries – as well as the rest of the worlddebt levels are increasing around the world — although this debt is mitigated because much of it is sovereign debt which is different from corporate and consumer debtif countries essentially owe debt to them selves not to creditors outside their country they can generally manage their debt america’s total debt to gdp is just about  while japan’s is approachingsuch debt is not necessarily a good thing because it can be politically destabilizing and overcomplicate policymaking however it is generally manageable because if a nation owes money to itself it is essentially real locating its income across various interest groups within the countryif the country can continue to grow it can still create more income for its citizensamerica’s debt level is rapidly increasing but is not at the danger levelwhile america does owe in excess of  trillion essentially  of its publicly held debt to creditors outside the country us companies and investors hold more than  trillion in total claims on foreigners including more than  trillion of foreign portfolio holdings and the us economy is worth more than  trillionso we earn more on foreign assets than we pay to foreign creditorsthis is not a major issuehowever our country’s debt level over the next  years will start to increase exponentially and at a certain point this could cause concern in global capital marketswe have time to address this problem but we should start to deal with the issue well before it becomes a crisis  iicomments on current critical issues people also point to emerging market debt – both corporate and sovereign – as a potential issue but the emerging markets both coun tries and companies are much bigger and stronger than they were in the pastthey have more foreign exchange reserves and generally more effective risk management of currency and interest rate mismatchesleveraged lending is increasing particularly through shadow bankstotal leveraged lending in the united states is approximately  trillionabout  of the loans are owned by banks the majority in more senior positions and the remaining  are owned by shadow banks or nonbanksdeconstructing that number a bit about  trillion is in us institutional leverage term loans – approximately  of which are owned by bankswe estimate that approximately  billion of direct loans are owned exclusively by nonbankswhile leveraged lending is a growing issue and one that we are monitoring we don’t think this is yet of the size or quality to cause systemic issues in the financial systemthis does not mean it won’t create some issueswhen things get bad invariably prices drop dramatically certain types of highyield debt cannot be refinanced etc – but at this level it is still a manageable issuethere are growing geopolitical tensions — with less certainty around american global leadershipgeopolitical tensions are always there – just reading the newspaper in any week in any year since world war ii would make anyone pretty worriedbut it does appear that geopo litical tensions are growinglet me mention a few russian aggression middle east conflicts venezuela north korea iran turkey brexit and european politics generallyit’s always difficult to understand the effect of geopolitical uncertaintybut it is now heightened due to uncertainty around how the united states intends to exercise global leadershipthis uncertainty may very well be the biggest new unknown factor affecting critical geopolitical and economic issuesthe chance of bad policy errors is increasingin this risk section and in the next section on public policy i feel compelled to empha size an obvious point bad public policy is a major riskit could be central banks and monetary policy trade snafus or simply deep political gridlock in an increasingly complex world – but bad policymaking is definitely an increasing risk for the global economythe confusion and uncertainty around liquidity are causing some legitimate concernsseveral times in the last few years including in the fourth quarter of  markets exhibited rapid losses of liquidity although fortunately and importantly the markets recovered in all cases – but that was in the context of a good environmentthe ongoing debate around liquidity and shortterm losses of liquidity in the market is an important onewe consider it in two ways traditional liquidity and macro liquidity • traditional liquidityi call it micro liquidity here and it generally refers to the width of the bidask spread as well as the size and speed with which securities can be bought or sold without dramatically affecting their pricethere is no question that some micro liquidity is more constrained than in the past due to bank capital liquidity and volcker rule requirementsin addi tion highfrequency traders generally create some intraday liquidity within a day though even this is unreliable in a downturnbecause they rarely take posi tions interday day to day traders do not create real liquidity but my view is that they increase the volatility of liquidity over timethere is no question that rules and regulations also cause unwanted and unnecessary distortions in money market vehicles such as repos and swaps particu larly at quarterendif you look at liquidity – from before the financial crisis to today – in fairly liquid markets like treasuries swaps and equi ties there is a noticeable differencein good markets liquidity is essentially high and is almost at the same level today as it  iicomments on current critical issues was before the crisisbut when markets became volatile in the last several years liquidity dropped much further and faster than it did before the crisisit is important to remember that this happened in good timestherefore it is reasonable to expect that what we have been experiencing is now the new normal of liquidity – and that we should be prepared for it to be even worse in truly difficult times • macro liquiditythis describes a broader view of financial conditionsfor example is it easy to borrow and lend are banks able to increase their lending is the cost of borrowing going up is the fed adding or reducing liquidity in the system essentially by buying or selling treasuries there is no doubt that new regulations particularly bank liquidity requirements dramatically reduce the ability of the fed to increase bank lending today by shoring up bank reservesin the old days the central bank could effectively create excess reserves by buying treasuriesthese excess reserves were lendable by the banktoday such reserves are often not lendable due to new liquidity rulesso bank lending as a func tion of deposits is in effect permanently reducedthe notion of “money velocity” and in fact the transmission of monetary policy are therefore different from the past and it is hard to calculate the full effect of all these changesit is extremely difficult for us and probably even for the fed to know when and at what level the removal of cash liquidity from the system starts to significantly affect macro or micro liquiditywe will however probably know it when we see itthere may be too much certainty that growth will be slow and inflation subduedthere is still global growth and employ ment and wages continue to go uphowever this has been a very slow recovery and it is possible that the “normal” increase of infla tion late in the cycle due to wage demands and limited supply can still happenwe don’t see it today but i would not rule it outin addition year bond spreads have been suppressed in some way by the extreme quantitative easing around the worldif that ever reverses in a material way how could it not have an effect on the year bond finally i would not look at the yield curve and its potential inversion as giving the same signals as in the pastthere has simply been too much interference in the global markets by central banks and regulators to under stand its full effect on the yield curveexpect banks to be far more constrained going into the next real downturntoday is nothing likethere are fewer leveraged financial assets in the system now than a decade agoin  huge losses in the mortgage market forced consumers and companies to sell assets acquired by borrowingfundamentally market panic ensuednow there is far less borrowing against assets and it is unlikely that there will be a lot of forced selling as a resulthowever keep in mind that it is still possible for investors to sell lots of assets if any form of market panic takes placewhen the next real downturn begins banks will be constrained – both psychologically and by new regulations – from lending freely into the marketplace as many of us did in  andnew regulations mean that banks will have to maintain more liquidity going into a downturn be prepared for the impacts of even tougher stress tests and hold more capital because capital require ments are even more procyclical than in the pasteffectively some new rules will force capital to the sidelines just when it might be needed most by clients and the marketsfor example in the next financial crisis jpmorganchase will simply be unable to take some of the actions we took in  as described in the sidebar on pagesthe fed is still quite powerful and retains numerous tools to deal with many of the issues described abovethere is excessive focus on what the fed says and does in the short termthe fed appro priately and by necessity needs to be data dependent – how could it be otherwise and of course while proper policy requires fed  iicomments on current critical issues officials to constantly think about the future though it does not require them to make specific forecasts public they can’t know what the future holds with any certaintybut they are deeply knowledgeable flexible and appropriately willing to change their mindsand counter to what you often hear today they retain a large number of tools at their disposalthey can change shortterm rates at will and in fact can effect change on longer term rates if they wantwith a few simple words they can change the future expecta tions of the interest rate curvethey can buy or finance an extraordinary amount of assets and they can revise regulations if necessary to improve liquidity or enhance lendingthey can often simply by asking get banks to take certain actions that they wantit is a mistake to think that they don’t have signifi cant tools at their disposalof course we hyperfocus on today’s prob lems and they often overshadow the prog ress we are making across the globewe should not overlook the positive signsin addition to the strong us economy the world is still growing trade issues may be properly resolved and brazil among others has turned the corner economicallyif a downturn starts and leads to darker scenarios we will be prepared and we also believe the us government will eventually respond adequatelywe are prepared for — though we are not predicting — a recessionthe key point here is that a fairly healthy us economy will be confronting a wide variety of issues in  andit’s hard to look at all the issues facing the world and not think that the range of possible outcomes is broader and that the odds of bad outcomes might be increasingand certain factors like confidence which we know is important can be easily damaged by bad policy unexpected events or even high market volatilitythe next recession may not resemble prior reces sionsnext time the cause may be just the cumulative effect of negative factors – the proverbial last straw on the camel’s backwe are always prepared to deal with the next recessionwe generally do not spend a lot of time guessing about when the next recession will be – we manage our business knowing that there will be cyclesfirst and foremost we will continue to serve our clientsfrom the prior parts of this letter you can see that we continued to make responsible loans to our clients during and after the great recession when they needed us most – and we will do that againwe will not stop investing in our future investing in technology or building new brancheswe will continue to make markets for our clientswe will not overreact to the credit cyclewe will mitigate riskwe may reduce risk by taking on fewer new clients or by syndi cating or hedging riskand we may reduce risk by managing our portfolio of securi ties and loans unrelated to clientswe will exercise more of our muscle in terms of managing expenses monitoring headcount and creating more efficiencieswe will have special credit teams created in advance to deal with any problematic creditsfinally we will be seeking out new ways to grow and competeour experience is that recessions do create opportunities for healthy companies to enhance their fran chises generally by serving clients where other companies cannot  there are many critical issues roiling the united states and other countries around the world today – just to name a few capitalism versus other economic systems the role of business in our society how the united states intends to exercise global leadership income inequality equal oppor tunity access to healthcare immigration and diversitymany people have lost faith in government’s ability to solve these and other problemsin fact almost all insti tutions – governments schools unions media and businesses – have lost credibility in the eyes of the publicin the meantime many of these problems have been around for a long time and are not aging wellpoli tics is increasingly divisive and a number of policies are not workingthis state of affairs is unlikely to get better without thor ough diagnosis thoughtful policy solutions and a commitment to a common purposethe american dream is alive — but fraying for manybefore i talk about our problems i think it’s important to put any negatives in context so first a paean to our nationamerica is still the most prosperous nation the world has ever seenwe are blessed with the natural gifts of land all the food water and energy we need the atlantic and pacific oceans as natural borders and wonderful neighbors in canada and mexicoand we are blessed with the extraordinary gifts from our founding fathers which are still unequaled freedom of speech freedom of religion freedom of enterprise and the promise of equality and opportunitythese gifts have led to the most dynamic economy the world has ever seen nurturing vibrant businesses large and small exceptional universities and a welcoming environment for innovation science and technologyamerica was an idea borne on principles not based upon histor ical relationships and tribal politicsit has and will continue to be a beacon of hope for the world and a magnet for the world’s best and brightestof course america has always had its flawssome of its more recent issues center on income inequality stagnant wages lack of equal opportunity immigration and lack of access to healthcarei make it a prac tice when hearing complaints to strive to understand where people might be right or partially right instead of rejecting or accepting their views reflexivelyiiipublic policy in this section i attempt to analyze and offer some views on what has caused this situation and then suggest some solutionsneither the diagnoses nor the proposed cures are purely my ownthese issues have been studied intensively by many people with deep knowledgeand given the space and other constraints of this letter i may be about to violate the einstein maxim which i love “everything should be made as simple as possible but not simpler” one of the main points i am trying to make is that when you step back and take a comprehensive multiyear view looking at the situation in its totality it is the cumulative effect of many of our policies that has created many of our prob lemsand whatever the solutions i think they are unlikely to be achieved by govern ment alone – civil society and business need to be part of the equationto start we must understand our problems  iiipublic policy middle class incomes have been stagnant for yearsincome inequality has gotten worseforty percent of american workers earn less than  an hour and about  of fulltime american workers earn the minimum wage or less which is certainly not a living wagein addition  of americans don’t have  to deal with unexpected expenses such as medical bills or car repairsmore than  million americans don’t have medical insurance at alland surprisingly  of those eligible for various types of federal assis tance programs don’t get any helpno one can claim that the promise of equal opportunity is being offered to all amer icans through our education systems nor are those who have run afoul of our justice system getting the second chance that many of them deserveand we have been debating immigration reform for  yearssimply put the social needs of far too many of our citizens are not being metover the last  years the us economy has grown cumulatively aboutwhile this may sound impressive it must be put into context after a sharp downturn economic growth would have been  over  years in a normal recoverytwenty percent more growth would have added  trillion to gdp which certainly would have driven wages higher and given us the wherewithal to broadly build a better countrykey questions that keep arising – and remain unanswered are why have productivity and economic growth been so anemic and why have income inequality and so many other things gotten worse included among the common explanations is that “secular stagnation” is the new normali’ve also heard blame placed on institutional greed and “shorttermism” bad corporate governance job displacement from new technologies immigration or trade and a lack of new productivityenhancing tech nologyanother common refrain is that capitalism and free enterprise have failedas you’ll see i think some of these argu ments miss the markwe must have a proper diagnosis of our problems — the issues are real and serious — if we want to have the proper prescription that leads to workable solutionsslogans are not policy and though simple and sometimes virtuoussounding they often lead to policies that failwellintentioned but poorly designed policies generally have large and unintended negative consequencespolicy should always be extremely welldesignedin my view too often we don’t perform the deep analysis required to fully understand our problemsone of the reasons is that we often have too short term an orientation ie looking at how things have changed yearoveryear or even quarteroverquarterwe frequently fail to look at trends over a multiyear period or over decades – we miss the forest for the treesit’s also important to point out that many economic models that are used to design policy have a hard time incorporating or accounting for the effect of certain factors that can be pivotal but are too complex or qualitative to modeli have tried to come up with a list of critical factors that greatly affect the health of an economy over many years such as educa tion infrastructure healthcare etcthe list is below and when you look at how we have performed in these areas it’s rather condemningour shortcomings in these areas clearly have impeded the prosperity of the us economy and have failed many of our fellow citizens over the past two decades or so  our problems what’s holding back our nation’s productivity and economic growth and reducing opportunity ineffective and outoftouch education systems many of our high schools vocational schools and community colleges do not properly prepare today’s younger generation for available professionallevel jobs many of which pay a multiple of the minimum wagewe used to be among the best in the world at training our workforce for good jobs but now we are falling shortthis is a huge reason for both inequality and lack of opportunityour innercity high schools are failing their communities and are leaving too many behindin some innercity schools fewer than  of students graduate and of those who do a significant number are not prepared for employment and are often relegated to a life of povertyproper training and retraining would also help in our rapidly changing technological worldfinally skills training has become increasingly important over time and the negligence of our education systems to be responsive to employers’ current needs has to have reduced gdp growthsoaring healthcare costs these now represent almost  of gdp — more than twice the cost per person compared with most developed nationswhile we have some of the best healthcare in the world our outcomes are not twice as good as those of the rest of the worldsome studies say that gains in life expectancy in the last  years were a significant contributor to us national wealth and health possibly equal to half of gdp growth as people were healthier and lived longer which generally improved the quality of the labor force and productivitythis may no longer be trueobesity costs our country  trillion a year because it drives so many illnesses ie heart disease diabetes cancer stroke and depressioneven worse  of today’s youth ages – are not eligible for military service essentially due to poor academic skills basic reading and writing or health issues often obesity or diabetesand outofpocket healthcare expenses for the average american have skyrocketed over the last  years causing huge anxiety particularly for lowincome families who have been hit with the highest increases in healthcare costsexcessive regulation and bureaucracy excessive regulation for both large and small companies has reduced growth and business formation without making the economic system safer or betterthe ease of starting a business in the united states has worsened and both small business formation and employment growth have dropped to the lowest rates in  yearsby some estimates approximately  trillion is spent on federal regulations annually which is about  per house holdwe need good regulations and we have to get better at effectively implementing them — accomplishing the desired good outcomes — while minimizing unnecessary costs and bad unintended consequencesinability to plan and build infrastructure it took eight years to get a man to the moon from idea to completion but it now can take a decade to simply get the permits to build a bridge or a new solar fieldthe country that used to have the best infrastructure on the planet by most measures is now not even ranked among the top  developed nations according to the world economic forum’s basic requirement index which reflects infrastructure along with other criteriawe are falling behind on airports bridges water highways aviation and moreone study examined the effect of poor infrastructure on efficiency for example poorly constructed highways congested airports with antiquated air traffic control systems aging electrical grids and old water pipes and concluded this could all be costing us more than  billion a yearphilip khoward who does some of the best academic work on america’s infrastructure estimates it would cost  trillion to fix our aging infrastructure — and this is less than it would cost not to fix itin fact a recent study by business roundtable found that every dollar spent restoring our infrastructure system to good repair and expanding its capacity would produce nearly  in economic benefitswhat happened to that “cando” nation of ours  previously uncompetitive tax system for business over the last  years as the world reduced its tax rates america did notour previous tax code was increasingly uncompetitive overly complex and loaded with specialinterest provisions that created winners and losersthis was driving down capital investment in the united states and giving an advantage to foreign companies thereby reducing productivity and causing wages to remain stagnantthe good news is the recent changes in the us tax system include many of the key ingredients to fuel economic expansion a business tax rate that will make the united states competitive around the world along with provisions to free us companies to bring back profits earned overseascapricious and

policies and reform forty percent of foreign students who receive advanced degrees in science technology and math  students annually have no legal way of staying here although many would choose to do somost students from countries outside the united states pay full freight to attend our universities but many are forced to take the skills they learned here back homefrom my vantage point that means one of our largest exports is brainpowerwe need more thoughtful meritbased immigration policiesin addition most americans would like a permanent solution to daca deferred action for childhood arrivals and a path to legal status for lawabiding taxpaying undocumented immigrants — this is tearing the body politic apartthe congressional budget office estimates the failure to pass immigration reform earlier this decade is costing us  of gdp a yearinefficient mortgage markets the inability to reform mortgage markets has dramatically reduced mortgage availabilityin fact our analysis shows that conservatively more than  trillion in additional mortgage loans might have been made over a fiveyear period had we reformed our mortgage systemjpmorgan analysis indicates that the cost of not reforming the mortgage markets could be as high as  of gdp a yearlack of proper federal government budgeting and planning this inevitably leads to waste inefficiency and constraints on multiyear planningone striking example it may cost the military at least  of its spending power when budgets are not approved on time and continuous spending resolutions are imposedand we don’t do some basic things well like account for loans and guarantees properly and demand appropriate funding of public pension plansstudent lending and debt irrational student lending soaring college costs and the burden of student loans have become a significant issuethe impact of student debt is now affecting mortgage credit and household formation — a  increase in student debt reduces subsequent homeownership rates byrecent research shows that the burdens of student debt are now starting to affect the economydramatic reduction in labor force participation wages for lowskilled work are no longer a living wage — the incentives to start work have been declining over timeadd to this the education issues already mentioned abovetwo other contributing factors are that many former felons have a hard time getting jobs and an estimated  million americans are currently addicted to opioids in  a staggering  americans died because of opioid overdosessome studies show that addiction is one of the major reasons why many men ages – are permanently out of work  iiipublic policy it is hard to look at these issues in their totality and not conclude that they have a significant negative effect on the great amer ican economic enginemy view is if you add it all up this dysfunction could easily have been a  drag on our growth ratebefore i talk about some ideas to address these issues i would like to discuss one major debate currently in the echo chamberis capitalism to blame is socialism better there is no question that capitalism has been the most successful economic system the world has ever seenit has helped lift billions of people out of poverty and it has helped enhance the wealth health and education of people around the worldcapitalism enables competition innovation and choicethis is not to say that capitalism does not have flaws that it isn’t leaving people behind and that it shouldn’t be improvedit’s essen tial to have a strong social safety net – and all countries should be striving for continuous improvement in regulations as well as social and welfare conditionsmany countries are called social democra cies and they successfully combine market economies with strong social safety netsthis is completely different from traditional socialismin a traditional socialist system the government controls the means of production and decides what to produce and in what quantities and often how and where the citizens work rather than leaving those decisions in the hands of the private sectorwhen governments control companies economic assets companies lenders and so on over time are used to further polit ical interests – leading to inefficient compa nies and markets enormous favoritism and corruptionas margaret thatcher said “the problem with socialism is that eventually you run out of other people’s money” socialism inevitably produces stagnation corruption and often worse – such as authoritarian government officials who often have an increasing ability to interfere with both the economy and individual lives – which they frequently do to maintain powerthis would be as much a disaster for our country as it has been in the other places it’s been triedi am not an advocate for unregulated unvar nished freeforall capitalism few people i know are but we shouldn’t forget that true freedom and free enterprise capitalism are at some point inexorably linkedsuccessful economies will create large successful companiesshow me a country without any large successful companies and i will show you an unsuccessful country – with too few jobs and not enough opportunity as an outcomeand no country would be better off without its large successful companies in addition to its midsized and small compa niesprivate enterprise is the true engine of growth in any countryapproximately  million people work in the united states  million work in private enterprise and only  million people in governmentas i pointed out earlier in this letter large successful companies generally provide good wages even at the starting level as well as insurance for employees and their families retirement plans training and other benefitscompanies in a free enter prise system drive innovation through capital investments and rd they are huge supporters of communities and they often are at the forefront of social policyare they the reason for all of society’s ills absolutely nothowever in many ways and without ill intent many companies were able to avoid – almost literally drive by – many of society’s problemsnow they are being called upon to do more – and they should  iiipublic policy we need to set aside partisan politicsnone of these issues is exclusively owned by democrats or republicansto the contrary it is clear that partisan politics is stopping collaborative policy from being implemented particularly at the federal levelthis is not some special economic malaise we are inthis is about our societywe are unwilling to compromisewe are unwilling or unable to create good policy based on deep analyticsand our govern ment is unable to reorganize and keep pace in the new worldplain and simple this is a collective failure to put the needs of society ahead of our personal parochial and partisan interestsif we do not fix these problems america’s moral economic and military dominance may cease to existin my view we need a marshall plan for americato do this democrats have to acknowledge that many of the things that have been done as a nation – often in the name of good – have sometimes not worked and need to be modifiedthrowing money at problems does not always workrecently a report showed that the federal government wasted nearly  billion on charter schools due to mismanagement and lack of adequate oversight – this was money intended to help childrendemo crats should acknowledge republicans’ legitimate concerns that sending money to washington tends to be simply seen as waste ultimately offering little value to local communitiesrepublicans need to acknowledge that america should and can afford to provide a proper safety net for our elderly our sick and our poor as well as help create an environment that generates more opportunities and more income for more americansand if we can demon strate that we are spending money wisely we should spend more – think infrastruc ture and education fundingand that may very well mean taxing the wealthy moreif that happens the wealthy should remember that if we improve our society and our economy then they in effect are among the main winnersour nation requires strong political leaders to develop good thoughtful poli cies use their political skills to determine what is doable and exercise their leader ship skills to lead people toward common sense solutionswe need to set aside our narrow selfinterestwe live in an increasingly complex world where companies governments unions and special interest groups vie for time attention and favorable circumstances for their respective institutionswhile it is a constitutional right to petition our govern ment and many organizations legitimately fight for the interests of their constituents we all may have become too selfinter estedi fear that this selfinterest is part of what is destroying the glue that holds our society togetherwe all share a collective responsibility to improve our countryi would like to give a few examples which represent the tip of the iceberg it would be easy to come up with thousands more • governments both federal and state fight to keep military bases open that we don’t need and veterans affairs hospitals that are broken – making the military more costly and less effectiveour shortcomings are not just about inefficiencies they border on immoralin an incredibly depressing story former secretary of defense bob gates describes how congress took years longer than it should have to approve the building of usarmy personnelall these issues are fixable but that will happen only if we set aside partisan politics and narrow selfinterest — our country must come first  iiipublic policy carriers that we needed in iraq and afghanistan to protect our soldiers from improvised explosive deviceswhile we dallied many of our soldiers died or received terrible lifelong injuriesfive states california connecticut illinois new jersey and new york fight for unlimited state and local tax deduc tions because those five states reap  of the benefit – even worse knowing that over  of the benefits from these deductions go to people who earn more than  a year • businesses are equally guilty herejust start digging through the tax code – buried in there are an extraordi nary number of loopholes credits and exemptions that aren’t about competi tiveness or good tax policysuffice it to say industry gets its share of tax breaks and forms of protection from legiti mate competitioni could add hospitals schools and unions to this list – none of our institutions is blamelesswhile leaders obviously fight for their institutions we all need to be able to advocate for policies that are good for our organizations without being bad for our countryand as a general matter we as citizens should support policies that are good for our country even if they may not be good for us individuallyfor too long too many have fought to use regulation and legislation to further their interests without appropriate regard for the needs of the countrygovernments must be better and more effective — we cannot succeed without their helpthe rest of us could do a better job toothe us federal government is becoming less relevant to what is going on in people’s livespeople have generally lost faith in the ability of institutions to deliver on their mission and meet societal needsthey are demanding change and we must recognize that change is neededwe need dramatic reform of our global and federal institu tions and how we attack our biggest soci etal challengesthere are signs of progress particularly in how local governments are starting to attack pressing problems – the ones that directly affect people’s lives like education housing and employmentlook at detroit and see how excellent leader ship is fixing a once failing citywe should continue to empower local governments to address the needs of our society but we should be asking our federal government to do the samei have already commented about needing real policies that include thoughtful plans to increase growth and create more oppor tunity for everyonefaster growth will raise incomes generate opportunities and create the wherewithal to fund improve ments in our social welfare programs on pages  i describe some possible solutions to the problems previously high lighted on pages  these solutions are not my own but are a synthesis of some of the best thoughts that we have seensome of these solutions are simple and some are more complexand obvi ously if they were politically easy to put into practice that would have been done by nowhowever i am convinced that if we could get ideas like these implemented economic growth and opportunity for all would be greatly enhanced  some solutions to how we might drive growth incomes and opportunity education we know what to dohigh schools and community colleges should work with local businesses to create specific skills training programs internships and apprenticeships that prepare graduating students to be jobready — whether they go on to earn a credential to work or to attend collegewith  million job openings and  million unemployed workers in the united states there is an opportunity for companies to work with local institutions including community colleges and local apprenticeship programsbusiness must be involved in this process and it needs to be done locally because that is where the actual jobs aregermany does an exceptional job at apprenticeshipsgermany has one of the strongest education and training systems in the world with about  million young people annually participating in apprentice ship programs that are paid opportunities to gain indemand skills along with an educationthe vocational schools and apprenticeship programs work directly with local businesses to ensure students are connected to available jobs upon graduationgermany’s youth unemployment rate is one of the lowest in the worldsome countries are now implementing mandatory preschool for children at three years of agethis is a wonderful policyit makes childcare less expensive and has proved to be extraor dinarily good for student education short and long termparents like it tooof course the benefits may not be seen for many years but this is precisely the type of longterm thinking in policymaking that we needhealthcare this may be our toughest most complicated problem but we know there are some things we can do to make the system work bettersome of the solutions may include aligning incentives better trying to eliminate the extraordinary amount of money wasted on bureaucracy administration and fraud empowering employees to make better choices with upfront transparency in employer plan pricing and options and the actual cost of medical procedures developing better corporate wellness programs focusing particu larly on obesity and smoking creating better tools to shop around for nonemergency care and manage healthcare expenses and reducing the extraordinary expense for unwanted endoflife careanother obvious thing to do is to start teaching wellness nutrition health and exercise in k classrooms nationwideregulatory reform starting a small business today generally requires multiple licenses which take precious months to getbut it doesn’t end theretalk with any small business owner and that person will describe the mountains of red tape inefficient systems and a huge amount of documentation involved to operate the businesswe need to reduce the number of licenses that are required to open and run a small businessin addition we should look at the excessive state and local rules affecting small businesses consolidating and eliminating unnecessary rules and regulations where possibleand all regulations should have a thorough costbenefit analysis and be periodically reviewed for current relevancyinfrastructure investment the  transportation spending bill fixing america’s surface transportation act fast act is intended to fund surface transporta tion programs — including highways — at over  billion throughits aim is to improve mobility on america’s highways create jobs and support economic growth decrease bureaucracy in getting projects approved and completed — and we need to finish its implementationagain experience from other countries may helpwe could learn from germany and canada for example whose officials endorsed large infrastructure projects and sped through permitting in two to three years by forcing federal state and local approvers to simultaneously work through a single vetting processsignificantly reducing the time of permitting also dramatically reduces the cost and uncertainty around making major capital investmentstax credits and benefits the business tax changes in the  tax law made the united states more competitive benefiting american workers today and strength ening our economy for the long termin  nominal wages increased  — the fastest rate of growth since  — and job openings exceeded the number of unemployed workers for the first time since the federal government started tracking these data inbeyond this important progress there is still more that policymakers could do to help working americansof the  million americans working today approximately  million earn between  an hour the prevailing federal minimum wage and  an hourit is hard to live on  an hour particularly for families even if two household members are workingwhile it would be acceptable to increase minimum wages this should be done locally  litigation while the rule of law and the right of plaintiffs to get their day in court are sacrosanct there have to be ways to improve this systemone example which works in many other countries is to have the loser pay in some circumstancesclearly this would have to be done in such a way as to ensure that aggrieved parties are not denied appropriate access to our justice systembut we need a way to reduce frivolous litigation designed principally to extract fees for lawyerswe also need to reduce the time and the cost necessary to achieve justice by adding more judges and creating more specialty courts to deal with complex issuesimmigration there has been support for bipartisan comprehensive legislation that provides substantial money for border security creates more meritbased immigration makes daca permanent and gives a path to legal status or citizenship for lawabiding hardworking undocumented immigrantswe know this is no easy feat but we should pass and enact legislation to resolve immigrationmortgage lending things can be done to reform mortgage markets which would increase mortgage availability — as i mentioned in the previous sidebar on pagesstudent lending we should have programs to ameliorate the burden of student loans on some former studentswe would be welladvised to have more properly designed underwriting standards around the creation of student loansdirect government lending to students has grown almost  over the last  years — and it has not all been responsible lendingit would also be helpful for the government to disclose student lending programs as if they were accountable on the same basis as a bankaddressing these factors would lead to far better and healthier student lendinglabor force participation we have already mentioned two critical solutions that would help improve labor force participation — make work pay more by expanding the eitc and provide graduating students with work skills that will lead to better paying jobsremember jobs bring dignitythat first job is often the first rung on the ladderpeople like working and studies show that once people start working they continue workingjobs and living wages lead to better social outcomes — more household formation more marriages and children and less crime as well as better health and overall wellbeingreducing recidivism of those who have been incarcerated is not only important to citizens with a criminal record and their families — but it can also have profound positive implications for public safetylast year we welcomed the federal deposit insurance corporation’s proposed changes to allow banks more flexibility in hiring citizens convicted of a crimeour responsibility to recruit hire retain and train talented workers extends to this population and we will support reentry programs and give convicted andor formerly incarcerated americans a path to wellpaying jobsfinally we should all be gratified that the government now seems to be taking the opioid problem very seriously and carefully so it does not increase unemploymentperhaps a more effective step would be to expand the earned income tax credit eitctoday the eitc supplements low to moderate income working individuals and couples particularly with childrenfor example a single mother with two children earning  an hour approximately  a year could receive a tax credit of more than  at year’s endlast year the eitc program cost the united states about  billion and  million individuals received the creditwe should convert the eitc to make it more like a negative income payroll tax which would spread the benefit reduce fraudulent and improper payments and get it into more people’s handsworkers without children receive a very small tax credit — this should be dramatically expanded tooproper budgeting and planning all levels of government should do proper budgeting and planning — and on a multiyear basisit is particularly important that most federal programs — think military infrastructure and education — have good longterm plans and be held accountable to execute themwhen the government says it is going to spend money it should tell the american people what the expected outcome is and report on itit should account for loans the same way the private sector does and it should be required to do costbenefit analysis  iiipublic policy somehow we need to help reinvent govern ment to make it more efficient and nimble in the new worldwhile the federal govern ment remains somewhat in a stalemate we have seen governors and mayors at the state and local levels taking active control and framing effective solutionsthey are helping to create a laboratory of what works and are often at the forefront with initiatives that restore confidence in the ability of govern ment to deliverwe also call upon ceos and other leaders to step up and offer nonparochial solutionsdespite the fact that ceos are not generally viewed with high levels of trust surprisingly the  edelman trust barometer global report – encompassing a general global population of more than  respondents – shows that  think ceos should take a stand on challenging issues and that  actually trust their employerwe believe ceos can and should get involved – particularly when they or their companies can uniquely help design policies that are good for americaat jpmorganchase we are strengthening our public policy teams to take our advocacy and ideas to the next levelwe believe the best way to scale programs that we have seen work in cities states and coun tries around the globe is to develop action able public policies that allow more people to benefit from economic growthwe can use our unique capabilities data and resources to help inform infrastruc ture policies corporate governance policies affordable housing policies financial educa tion policies and inclusion policies as well as small business financing and formation community and economic development and othersin addition while almost all compa nies can help further job skills training and diversity and inclusion efforts each company can also add value where it has distinct capabilities like expertise around healthcare infrastructure or technologyone final thought if i were king for a day i would always have a competitive business tax system and invest in infrastructure and education as a sine qua non to maximize the longterm health and growth of our economy and our citizensi would not trade these issues off – i would figure out a way to properly pay for themceos your country needs you it’s not enough just for companies to meet the letter and the spirit of the lawthey can also aggressively work to improve societythey can take positions on public policy that they think are good for the countryand they can decide with proper policies and regulatory oversight with whom and how they will do businesshowever this does get complexwhat companies cannot do is abridge the law of the land or abrogate the rights of voters and their representatives to set the law of the landthere are circumstances in which jpmorganchase is called upon to do things andor set policies that should have been set by the federal government – in effect these are decisions that the voter must decidewe work very hard to try to stay on the right side of all these issuesin any event things have changedin the past boards and advisors to boards advised company ceos to keep their head down and stay out of the line of firenow the opposite may be trueif companies and ceos do not get involved in public policy issues making progress on all these prob lems may be more difficult  iiipublic policyamerica’s global role and engagement are indispensableone of the biggest uncertainties in the world today is america’s role on the world stagea more secure and more prosperous world is also good for the longterm security and prosperity of the united statesand america’s role in building that more secure world has been and will likely continue to be indispensablewhile there are many legitimate complaints about international organizations the north atlantic treaty organization the world trade organization and the united nations the world is better off with these institutionsamerica should engage and exercise its power and influence cautiously and judiciouslywe should all understand that global laws standards and norms will be established whether or not our nation partic ipates in setting themit is certain that we will be happier with the evolution of global standards if we help craft and implement themwe should not abdicate this roleto the contrary it is critical that america help develop the best global standards in trade immigration corporate governance and many other important issueswhile i have a deep and abiding faith in the united states of america and its extraordinary resiliency and capabilities we do not have a divine right to successour challenges are significant and we should not assume they will take care of themselveslet us all do what we can to strengthen our exceptional unioni would like to express my deep gratitude and appreciation for the employees of jpmorganchasefrom this letter i hope shareholders and all readers gain an appreciation for the tremendous character and capabilities of our people and how they have helped communities around the worldi hope you are as proud of them as i am

dear fellow shareholders what a yeardespite tremendous challenges your company earned  billion in net income on revenue of  billion inour financial results reflected strong underlying performance across our four main businesses — unfortunately marred by significant legal settlements largely related to mortgagesthese legal expenses cost the company  billion aftertaxexcluding these expenses and some onetime positive benefits from reserve reductions which we never have considered true earnings and onetime gains on the sale of assets your company earned about  billionas tough as the year was — the company was under constant and intense pressure — i can hardly express the admiration even pride i feel because of the enduring resolve and resiliency of our management team and our employeesthey never wavered as they attacked our problems while maintaining a relentless focus on serving our clientswe all owe them a great deal of gratitudethe bad news was badthe most painful difficult and nervewracking experience that i have ever dealt with professionally was trying to resolve the legal issues we had this past year with multiple government agencies and regulators as we tried to get many large and risky legal issues behind us including the chief investment office cio situation that happened in  and mortgagerelated matters that happened jamie dimon chairman and chief executive officer  primarily in  a significant portion of which occurred at heritage bear stearns and washington mutual wamuthere is much to say and a lot to be learned in analyzing what happened but i am not going to do so in this letter — more distance and perspective are requiredsuffice it to say we thought the best option perhaps the only sensible option — for our company our clients and our shareholders — was to acknowledge our issues and settle as much as we could all at once albeit at a high pricethis allowed us to focus on what we are here for serving our clients and communities around the worldthe good news is that our four franchises maintained — and even strengthened — our leadership positions as we continued to gain market share and improve customer satisfaction in every businesswhen i look back at our company last year with all of our ups and downs i see it as a tale of two cities “it was the best of times it was the worst of times” we came through it scarred but

of our four major businesses oper ates at good economies of scale and gets significant additional advantages from the other businesseswe believe this is one of the key reasons we have maintained good financial performancebelow are some pretty powerful examples • our north america investment bank generates  of its investment banking revenue through commercial bank clients covered locallythis helps both our investment bank and our commercial bank do a better job serving their clients • our global corporate bank helped generate  billion in revenue for our fixed income sales and trading operation increasing business to our trading desks and helping them offer better pricing to our clients • our private bank gets new clients from both our investment bank and our commercial bankand the private bank and commer cial bank would have a hard time existing without our chase retail branch networkin fact  of commercial bank clients and  of private bank households visit our retail branches each quarter • of our  trillion of assets under management approximately  billion comes from the corporate  investment bank cib the commercial bank or the consumer bank • fiftyfive percent of retail mortgages and  of chasebranded credit cards are sold through the retail branchesin total we believe that the combination of our businesses accounts for  billion of additional revenue which helps drive both profits and customer satisfactioneach of our businesses would be worse off but for the other threeour capabilities are extraordinary and are difficult to replicate — we can bring huge resources to bear for the benefit of our company and our clients our scale creates huge cost efficiencies and enables significant resources to be brought to bear for the benefit of our companyfor example in global technology we have nearly  programmers application developers and information technology employees who keep our  applications  data centers  servers  desk tops and global network operating smoothly for all our clientsresources like these allow us to constantly improve our operating efficiencies and bring enormous capability to deal with issues when we need to do so such as adjusting to

financial crisis and throughout our year history jpmorganchase always has been there for our constitu ents around the world – not only in good times but more critically in the toughest of times when strong banks are needed the mosthowever terrifying events became we never wavered in supporting our clients and communitiesin fact we did many bold and unprecedented things including acquiring bear stearns and wamuand we never stopped raising capital and providing credit for companies nonprofits states municipali ties hospitals and universities during times of troubleand when the situation became very difficult in european countries such as greece italy and spain we stayed to help our clients which included the countries themselveswhile we may make mistakes along the way we never lose sight of why we are herewe believe that our longterm view and consistent behavior earn us the trust and respect of our clients and the communities in which we operateour strategy remains the same — and we always invest for the long run while we need to make a lot of adjustments to adapt to the new world i will discuss later in this letter how we intend to do that we are fortunate not to have to do a strategic resetour strategies have worked – a consis tent strategy properly executed is important for the longterm success of any companyso whatever the future brings we will face it from a position of strength and stabilityand we will continue to do what we always have done – manage the company and invest for the long run   iiwe will dedicate extraordinary effort in  adapting to the new global financial architecture while we will meet all of our new capital and liquidity requirements this year we still have an enormous amount of work to do to conform and adapt to the plethora of new global rulesthe changes are substantial and will require significant changes to business practices a quick look at the chart on the next page will give you a sense of the enor mous number of new rules and reporting requirements with which we need to complythey are global and range from the new european union eu markets in financial instruments directive mifid rules to the  doddfrank rules to the basel iii capital and liquidity require ments the volcker rule and new mort gage rules around both origination and servicing to name just a fewfully complying with and adapting to the new world is a daunting task and will require enormous effort and energy on the part of all of us at jpmorganchasewe are going to get it right – both to meet the letter and spirit of the new regulations and to mini mize disruption to our clientsthese rules will affect every client every product every system and every country in which we operatewe do not underes timate the extent of the changesnever before have we focused so much time technology money and brainpower on such an enterprisewide undertakingin the end all these efforts will make us a better and stronger companyimportantly these new regulations in total have unquestionably made the global banking system safer more transparent and more accountable – which is good for everybodyevery bank is far better capi talized than in the past and the liquidity in the system probably has never been higherin addition the new rules around minimum unsecured debt levels the recovery and resolution plans or socalled living wills and the strengthened capabilities of the regu lators have put an end we hope to the idea that anybody is “too big to fail” we are applying enormous resources to the task reading the bullet points below will give you a sense of the time money and manpower we are applying to adapt to the new rules •  employees will have been added since the beginning of  through the end of  to support our regula tory compliance and control effort risk compliance legal finance technology oversight and control and audit across the entire firm •  of our employees across our lines of business will be dedicated solely to building and

this effortin total it is hard to measure the overall scope and investment since nearly all employees and systems are engaged in some way or anotherwe will be applying the new rules all the way to the client level the product level and the trading desk we will be applying the new rules particu larly around capital liquidity and the slr and the factors that increase our capital surcharge as a global systemically impor tant bank all the way down to each client we serve each product we offer and each trading desk we operatedoing so will allow our client executives as well as product and trading managers to understand how the new rules affect us at a very granular level and allow our professionals to begin making proper and compensating adjustmentsat the most basic level some of these rules conflict with one another for example the client may be profitable on basel iii capital but not on slr capital or vice versathe binding constraint at the client level may be very different from the binding constraint at the firmwide levelto be successful we will need to actively manage all these constraints so we get a fair return on our capital and properly manage our risksat the firmwide level once we satisfy basel iii capital slr capital and the liquidity coverage ratio the binding constraints on the firm may very well become the ccar test the annual stress test from the federal reserve boardby its nature the ccar test is less predictable because it will change every yearand while you can’t effectively manage stress testing at the client or product level we will manage it at the business level so that it has more predictable outcomes allowing for more predictable capital planningwe are big believers in stress testing and you should know that we do it all the time and successfully conduct a large number of different kinds of stress tests every weekthis enables us to effectively manage risk to protect your companythe new rules will have a major effect on certain clients and products all the new rules will not affect all clients and all products equallyi obviously can’t cover all client types and products but i would like to give some examples of those that may be affected more than most – and what that impact means for both jpmorganchase and our clientsderivativesnoncorporate users of deriva tives asset managers hedge funds finan cial companies governments etc will have to move all their standardized derivatives mostly interest rate and credit derivatives to exchanges as opposed to handling them directly with a bankcorporate end users of derivatives will be allowed to continue to trade bilaterally with a bankhowever for both of these segments the cost to offer derivatives to our various client groups will increase due to capital liquidity and margin requirements imposed on usit still remains to be seen how all this will sort outnonoperational depositsessentially these are deposits that wholesale clients hold with us that typically are short term and trans actional in naturewe take these deposits more as a service to the client – not because they are profitable for usthe new rules require us to hold  of hqla against financial institution deposits and  against nonfinancial corporate depositsin addition based on current proposals we would have to hold  equity against the assets we maintain for financial institutions even if those assets consist of cash or other lowrisk assets such as government bondsthis makes nonoperational deposits hugely   unable to reform the governmentsponsored enterprises gse or to get the securitization markets healthy againthis has real costs to consumers especially for lower creditquality consumers and particularly for government guaranteed mortgages which have become more expensive more time intensive and less available for consumersoriginators are being more conservative because making loans that may default has become far more risky and costly due to • the highly litigious environment and uncertainty surrounding federal housing administration fha guarantees with respect to fha mortgages • the ongoing “putback” risk and the litigation costs around reps and warranties from the gses and sophisticated private investors • the increasing prescriptiveness of rules on servicing from different – and sometimes conflicting – regulators and government agencies • the increasing difficulty of moving servicing – again especially for highrisk loans which often are unprofitable to us and other large financial institutions – to other servicers that have systems and processes better able to serve these customersthese issues make mortgages more costly and unpredictable for companies and far less consumer friendlyin many cases deserving lower and middleincome consumers may pay far more than they might have in the past for a mortgage or worse yet they won’t be able to get onewe need for all those involved in the mort gage business to come up with a practical set of coherent and consistent policies that work for originators servicers investors unprofitable therefore over time banks probably will minimize this type of deposit and clients will seek other alternatives prob ably in the money marketscommitted undrawn revolversmany clients have large committed unused revolvers so they can manage their cash flows and not leave too much unused cash on their balance sheetbecause new rules impose liquidity and additional capital requirements on committed undrawn revolvers the cost involved in providing them could increase by up to  basis points depending on the client segment and nature of the facilitybanks will either have to charge more for this product or focus more acutely on the nature and value of the particular client rela tionship as a whole in considering whether to make revolvers available to that clienttrade financethe cost of shortterm trade finance and standby letters of credit also will increase dramatically with pricing poten tially up by  basis points in the long termthe rates business mostly trading government securities and interest rate swapsthe new rules have a huge effect on this business because they require substantially more capital and liquidityand for some banks the rates business has gone from profitable to unprofitable causing some banks to exit the business altogetherbecause of our large volume and low costs we already have begun to make significant changes to this business and expect to maintain decent profitabilitythe mortgage businessthe us mortgage market still faces huge hurdles and has a long way to go before it is a wellfunctioning market that is good for consumers and the country’s economic health and makes sense for financial companiesthere has been a large increase in the capital required to service and hold mortgagesservicing itself has become far more costly and dangerous to the servicer – servicing costs alone have gone up  basis pointswe still have been   consumers and regulatorswhile it’s crit ical to protect the consumer the new rules should not allow for arbitrary and capricious interpretations or overly punitive penalties and litigationwhen you look at how the cost of specific products has changed it’s easy to see how some clients will be affected more than otherswhile most clients will see some higher costs certain clients – for example municipalities which will see far higher costs for certain types of deposits and credit lines clients with large amounts of trade creditonly clients and specific types of finan cial companies – will experience far higher costs to transact banking businesswe need to achieve proper crossborder regulatory coordination one of the initial objectives of the global regulatory regime was to set out fairly consis tent global rules ie a level playing fieldthe rules don’t have to be exactly the same in all countries but if they are dramatically different that could cause large and unfair distortions in global competitionsome areas at risk are  dramatically different calcula tions of riskweighted assets  much lower leverage ratios in some countries vs others and  varying capital structures for a bank’s subsidiaries in different countrieswe are convinced that the regulators want to get this right but there are a lot of interests involved and only time will tell if they succeedwe need to recognize that models and risk weighted assets do not reflect all knowledge or judgment we recognize the importance of detailed and disciplined modeling and forecasting particu larly around risk and riskweighted assetsbut we want our shareholders to know that even the best models provide an incomplete some times misleading and backwardlooking view of risklet me list a few things that are not incorporated in riskweighted asset models • character of the borrower • changes in the tax code • changes in the structure of the industry usually driven by technology – look at what the internet did to media and some types of retail • changes in business practices for example virtually no one offers subprime mortgage lending anymore • changes in government or regulatory policy • geopolitical riskwe need to do our math right but we also need to remind ourselves to always try to add judgment and wisdomall things being equal returns will be reduced if you have to hold higher capital and higher liquidity and some of your costs are higher – all things being equal – your returns obvi ously will come downmany analysts have estimated that the average effect of the higher capital liquidity and costs on banks will reduce their return on equity substantially and for some banks far below fair market returnsthese banks possibly would need to take dramatic action – shareholders would not accept poor market returns for longbut all things are not equal clients markets and businesses adjust to changing economic circumstancesour company already has taken action that gives us some confidence that we will be able to maintain decent returns in spite of what a static analysis would showthe list below notes some of those things that likely will change over time and in general will allow banks on average to earn market returns   • runoff of unprofitable productsbanks simply will stop handling some very expen sive productsfor example many exotic derivatives subprime mortgages and other products no longer will be offered • product repricingsome products will repricefor example we expect the cost to the client for revolvers and transactional deposits to go up • product redesignsome products will be redesignedfor example uncommitted lines of credit that were popular many years ago may make a comebackor revolvers may be written so that the borrower cannot borrow all the money all at once reducing the liquidity burden and cost to the bank • client selection and reoptimizationbanks will focus on clients that can be served prof itably with a mix of products and servicesfor example we may seek to earn more of certain clients’ capitallite business like cash management or a higher share of their fee based business such as ma or issuancesome clients will go to other banks with a different mix of products and services and some will be banked in the shadow banking market which may be able to serve some clients in a less expensive way • tactical and strategic changesthese changes are hard to forecast – but they will happennot all banks will adjust to the new world in the same waysome banks will stop offering certain products or will leave certain markets – market shares will change and in some cases consolidatethis eventu ally should lead to margins in each product and business that are adequate for those that remain in the business • return on equitysome banks will continue to earn betterthanaverage roesnot all companies are created equal and in every industry that i have observed some compa nies have outperformed for an extended period of timesometimes it is because these companies have lower cost struc tures better technology or simply greater economies of scale due to higher market shareit also is important to remember that a complex business that has many products is not earning the same roe on every productmany industries have historic structural issues that lead to some products being loss leaders eg selling milk at grocery storesand some products have an extremely high return because there is little equity involved for example think of money management transaction processing etcit is the combination of how a company does all these things that determines the company’s aggregate roein the past we told you we would expect our average return on tangible equity through the cycle by this we mean in average times with normalized credit losses to bewith higher levels of capital significant regulatory changes and some remaining uncertainties we moved the number to be somewhere between  andwe continue to have a healthy fear of the unknown because we cannot predict the cumulative effect of so many changes on a complex system we still worry about the cumulative effect of all the changes which simply cannot be knownit is our nature to worry more about the downside than to guess about the upside however some of these changes actu ally may be good for jpmorganchase and other banksit could be that these changes may make it harder for new competitorsit is possible that many of these changes will create a bigger “moat” around the banking systemregardless we will be vigilant in looking for and reacting to any negative effects that we simply cannot predict today   what we can predict is that we are going to have tough global competitors we have a healthy fear of and respect for our competitorsno matter what business you’re in or how strong you might look there are a lot of smart devoted tough competi tors that have the potential to gain on youso we always make the assumption that we will have tough competitionin addition to the regular lineup of great competitors that we currently have i want to point out three areas among others that we will be keeping an eye onlarge global chinese bankstoday there are four very large and rapidly growing chinese banksthey may be operating under less restrictive rules than we arethey are ambi tious and they have a strategic reason to go global following their rapidly growing chinese companies overseasthey have begun their global expansion and over time they will become tough global competitorstechnological obsolescenceit’s easy to be scared about this onemany companies are working on new payment systems trading has become increasingly electronic customers want more and more mobile services and increasingly companies are starting to handle lending onlineyour company is deploying substantial resources and launching new programs and products and will try to be creative innovative and nimble in all these areas which we will talk more about in the last section of this letterincreasingly sophisticated shadow bankswe really should not call them “shadow” banks – they do not operate in shadowsthey are nonbank financial competitors and there is a wide set of themthey range from money market funds and asset managers mortgage real estate investment trusts and mortgage servicers and middle market lending funds to paypal and clearinghousesmany of these institutions are smart and sophisticated and will benefit as banks move out of certain products and servicesnonbank financial competitors will look at every product we price and if they can do it cheaper with their set of capital providers they willthere is nothing inherently wrong with this – it is a natural state of affairs and in some cases may benefit the clients who get the better pricebut regulators should – and will – be looking at how all financial companies including nonbank competitors need to be regulated and will be evaluating what is better to be done by banks vs nonbanks and vice versawe will spend a lot of energy in  adapting adjusting and navigating to the new financial architecture as well as monitoring its impact on our clients and keeping a watchful eye on the landscape as we move forward   we continue to make substantial progress strengthening our companywe have made enormous strides on our control agenda which is detailed in a letter by our chief operating officer on pageswe have continued our disciplined organic growth while also simplifying our business and continuing to reduce expensesbut first and foremost is the importance of maintaining the strength of our client franchisesin this new global financial architecture we will protect our great client franchises — at the expense of profits if necessary as we adapt to all the new rules we will deliberately maintain our franchises even at the expense of suboptimal profitssince we don’t know what the impact of all the new rules will be we don’t want to guess or make major changes in strategy in anticipation of these new rulesif some of the changes cause disappointing profits in the short term so be itwe are fairly convinced that we will be able to adjust and earn fair profits in the long runwe are aggressively pruning and simplifying our business — allowing us to reduce risk and to focus our resources on what is important in general it is good for any company to diligently prune and simplify its business so that it can focus on what it does bestthis is just simple good housekeepingit is even more important in this environment largely to help with the control agendathe chart below notes that we are exiting certain products and businessesnone of these exits will affect our main franchisesthese actions eventually will reduce revenue by about

growth of the companywe are driving down costs by being extremely vigilant on expenses – always seeking out ways to automate and improve efficiency and operationswhile we don’t have a formal expensecutting program you can rest assured that we always are looking for ways to cut wasteful expenditureswe also believe that new industry utilities will emerge that will sharply reduce costs for example a utility could manage know your customer processes this way corporate customers would not have to fill out the same forms and answer the same questions for all their banking partnersthe financial sector always has been a large user of industrywide utilities particularly with regard to processes like settlement clearance and paymentsand we always are learning which also will make us a stronger company we always have believed that analyzing your mistakes makes you a better companywe often are asked about some of the manage ment lessons we’ve learned over the past few years so let me share a few of them with youcustomer advocacytreat the customer the way you want to be treated and make sure you see everything from the customer’s eyesread customer complaints – and be the customer’s advocatethis acts as an early warning system it reduces problems and it will make you a better companyconstantly improving systems and processeswe always have believed in this but there is an example of where we didn’t with our anti money laundering systemsfor years we scored fairly well on our aml program but we did not continually improve our systems and processes and in hindsight we fell behindall systems and processes need to have regular review and continual improvementa tin earin the past few years we had started to see regulatory and enforcement actions against our competitors – and saw signals from our regulators that things were going to get tougher going forwardour response generally was “we know what we’re doing” well we should have done more selfexaminationwe need to be better listeners and do a better job at examining critiques of others so we can learn from other people’s mistakes tooenterprisewide controlswe generally have had a preference for leaving things some what decentralized if possible to foster responsibility and innovation throughout the organizationwe’ve prided ourselves on our controls and for the most part we did them wellbut not all critical controls were consistently executed throughout the firm – and they should have beenthis reduces the chance of a control gap somewhere in the company and it ensures a sustainable rigorous discipline and process in place every wherein addition to our fortress balance sheet we want a fortress control systemprocesses should be known front to backfrom the moment a customer is opening his or her account to conducting business through the middle office to properly recording that busi ness on your books and records you are only as strong as your weakest linkmanagement teams need to understand and review all the processes in their businesssustainabilityit’s not enough for an activity to be done well – it needs to be done well on a sustained basisthis means a rigorous risk assessment a constant review of all processes properly functioning risk and control committees vigilant compliance and a thor ough rechecking of everything by audityour management is taking full responsibility for all aspects of our business operationstransparency and escalation are key so we can deal with problems properly and quicklywhile we need to be extremely selfcritical we intend to do this in an environment of collaboration without fingerpointing  cybersecurity update in last year’s letter i gave a frank assessment about cybersecurity and why it is such a critical priority for the entire companywe outlined how jpmorganchase had spent approximately  million in  to protect ourselves from cyberwarfare and to make sure our data were safe and secure and we dedicated more than  employees across the firm to the taskdespite these intense efforts we acknowledged that the issue of cybersecurity worried us — and today that worry only has continued to intensifyby the end of  we will have spent more than  million annually with approximately  people focused on the effortthis effort will continue to grow exponentially over the yearsin our existing environment and at our company cybersecurity attacks are becoming increasingly complex and more dangerousthe threats are coming in not just from computer hackers trying to take over our systems and steal our data but also from highly coordinated external attacks both directly and via thirdparty systems eg suppliers vendors partners exchanges etcit appears that a large successful attack on a major retailer last year was the result of a thirdparty system breachwe are continuing to carefully protect our perimeter from external threats beef up our processes to detect internal threats and monitor related thirdparty systems to make sure their protections are adequatein addition we are moving rapidly ahead with europay mastercard visa emv and tokenization for credit and debit card transactions which we will need to do in conjunction with merchantswe also are building three stateoftheart cybersecurity operations centers in our regional headquarters to provide points of coordination for all incoming information the identification of threats the protocol around managing our responses and the security of our buildings around the worlda major focus of these centers is the concept of intelligence fusion which will pull together all our internal information from internet and systems monitoring as well as reconnaissance from our partners in industry and governmentthis approach will give us a comprehensive and consolidated view of all the threats facing our firm and our customers and it will help to inform our view on how best to combat themwe’re making good progress on these and other efforts but cyberattacks are growing every day in strength and velocity across the globeit is going to be a continual and likely neverending battle to stay ahead of it — and unfortunately not every battle will be wonrest assured that we will stay vigilant and do what we need to do to enhance our defenses and protect our company    in the last seven years we have been through a global financial crisis massive regulatory changes and a number of setbacks – but our company has been able to recover and prospermost important our client fran chises consistently got strongerall compa nies at some point are going to have tough timesthe ability of a company to overcome them and be better for having done so is a sign of its strength not weaknessas we navigate through  our fortress company and the power of our franchises put us in good steadwe are in this busi ness foreverand we need to look beyond current challenges so that we properly invest and plan for the futurewhen all is said and done there is reason to believe that the future of banking will be quite goodthe following paragraphs explain whythe world has been getting better not worse it is hard to believe sometimes – when you read in the newspapers and see on tv all the terrible events happening on the planet – that the world has consistently over the course of history become a better place for human beingsa recent book by harvard professor steven pinker entitled the better angels of our nature chronicles how mankind has made enormous progress and has improved society throughout the centurieshis research looks at issues like murder torture and other acts of violence over the past thousands of years and shows how today’s world is much safer and more humane than in the pastit’s amazing that even the th century bloodied by two world wars was less violent than all other centu ries before itcruelties such as torture and slavery over many many years have become increasingly rare though they tragically still existthere are many contributing factors but pinker points out some of the reasons increasingly just and moral governments the invention of new institutions like courts of law and police forces and expansion of human knowledge and a heightened sense of morality spread by the written word reli gious institutions and schools all of which have helped influence people’s minds about what is acceptable – and what is notdrmartin luther king said “the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward justice” progress sometimes painful and slow has been happening all around us all the time and the optimist in me believes that it will continuewe have an abiding faith in the united states of america i have spoken about this in the past and i don’t believe that it is blind optimism or patriotismamerica today may be stronger than ever beforefor example • the united states has the world’s stron gest military and this will be the case for decadeswe also are fortunate to be at peace with our neighbors and to have the protection of two great oceans • the united states has among the world’s best universities and hospitals • the united states has a reliable rule of law and low corruption • the people of the united states have a great work ethic and “can do” attitude • americans are among the most entre preneurial and innovative people in the world – from those who work on the factory floors to geniuses like steve jobsimproving “things” and increasing produc tivity are american pastimesand america still fosters an entrepreneurial culture where risk taking is allowed – accepting that it can result in success or failureivwe believe our longterm outlook is bright   • the united states is home to many of the best businesses on the planet – from small and middlesized companies to large global multinationals • the united states also has the widest deepest most transparent and best finan cial markets in the worldand i’m not talking just about wall street and banks – i include the whole mosaic venture capital private equity asset managers individual and corporate investors and the public and private capital marketsour financial markets have been an essential part of the great american business machineamerica’s future is not guaranteed and of course america has its issueslater in this section i will discuss some of the issues especially the ones possibly holding back our country’s growthbut throughout history we have shown great resiliency and a capacity to face our problemswarren buffett the greatest investor of all time and my friend has said “it’s never paid to bet against america” i think we all should take his advicethe outlook for longterm growth is excellent — our clients are growing and they need us the financial needs of countries companies and individuals will continue to grow over timeand that growth will be broad based and globala few examples sufficegdp and trade • world gross domestic product gdp is projected to grow an average of  per year through  from  trillion in  to  trillion in  • the value of the world’s exports grew at an average rate of  per year between  and  from  trillion to  trillionmany economists expect international trade to grow faster than world gdp over timeinfrastructure • keeping pace with global gdp growth will require an estimated  trillion in infra structure investment between now and  – this is  more than the  tril lion spent over the past  yearsemerging economies are likely to account for  to  of this infrastructure spending • infrastructurerelated trade is forecast to grow by  per year on average between  and  outpacing overall merchandise trade growth of  per year so that by  infrastructurerelated trade will account for  of total goods traded globallygrowth of large companies • a staggering  new large companies those with revenue greater than  billion are expected to develop between  and   are expected to be in emerging regions with the share of large company revenue generated from those based in emerging regions rising from  in  to  in  • by  emerging regions are expected to be home to almost  companies in the fortune global  up from  inof the  emerging region companies  are expected to be based in the china region • today  of the  large compa nies in emerging economies are spread across almost  cities by   of the  large companies are likely to be spread across nearly  citiesurbanization and population growth • a majority of the world’s population now lives in urban areas for the first time in history and by  that number is expected to grow tothis mass urbanization will create cities on a scale beyond what most of the world has seenproviding the infrastructure and clean water schooling healthcare and social safety nets to name just a few to anticipate accommodate and sustain this growth will be hugely challengingfinancial assets • total global financial assets of consumers and businesses grew to  trillion by the end of  and are projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of  through  to roughly  trillion • much of this growth is expected to come from emerging market economies which consisted of  of global financial assets in  and is expected to grow to  by    all the points above are the fuel that drives all of our businessesthe growth will be therethe hard part about our businesses is managing the complexity and the often volatile and violent swings of moods and markets as well as the episodic nature of some of the businesses not all of our busi nesses operate on a convenient annual cycle what we try to do is see through the fog and noise and the madness of crowds to clearly consistently and safely manage our busi nesses and invest in our futureof course risk and uncertainty remain but we need to put it all into perspective of course there is risk in the systemthere always was and there always will beas a company we need to be prepared for even the unlikely and unpredictable bad outcomesbut like everything else it helps to put risk into perspectivesome of the common risks spoken about today include geopolitical risks and what some think are inflated stock market values i am not going to talk about the stock market as i have little to add to that debateprobably the most discussed area of uncertainty is what effect the reversal of the fed’s quantitative easing qe policy will have on the economy and marketsi will speak about fed policy later in this sectionhere i will briefly review some of the risk issues we see todaygeopolitical risk is a constant history teaches us that geopolitical risk is always theresome of the risks are well known to us such as afghanistan iran north korea etcbut many of the risks are not known and they often are the ones that create huge problemsfor example most people did not foresee the events in the middle east the “arab spring” the start of world war i or the serious issues in the eurozone to name a fewmany of the changes in the geopolitical world were hugely positive for example the falling of the berlin wall the reemergence of china in the global economy and the spreading of democracy throughout many parts of the worldtwo years ago there was deep fear about the collapse of the eurozone which of course hasn’t happenedwhen i graduated from business school  years ago the great fear at the time was that america had seen its best days and was soon to be surpassed by a resurgent japanwhile we are prepared and watchful we see nothing that would change our longterm plansthere are many positive factors • consumers are in increasingly good finan cial shapeover  million more americans are working since the depths of the financial crisisthe amount of consumer income that they spend to service their debt is the lowest it has been since it has been recorded dating back toand americans’ net worth has been increasing along with stock market prices and the value of homes • housing has turned the corner in most marketswe’ve moved from a buyer’s market to a seller’s market in four years construction of new homes has steadily improved and home values have increased nationally more than  in the past two years due to the strengthening economy • capital markets are wide open – credit for the most part is flowing freely the only exception i see here is that it still is too hard to get a mortgage for many people • corporations and middle market compa nies are in extremely good shapecorpo rate cash balances now are  of assets up from  in  • the banking system is almost fully recov ered and banks are better capitalized than they have been in  yearsbanks had average equity to assets of  in  – the highest it’s been sinceand banks in total have  trillion in deposits vs  trillion in loans today – the lowest loantodeposit ratio sincein addition banks currently hold hqla of approximately  trillion • consumers are benefiting from abundant and less costly oil and gas due to techno logical advances in extraction   but something is holding back our growth something is holding back the strong recovery of the great american economic engineit is not lack of access to capital or loans but it might be a combination of some of the following factors • concerns around excessive regulation and red tape – i travel around the us all the time and this is a loud and growing complaint that i hear from businesses small to large across virtually all industries • whether you were for or against “obama care” when massive changes to such an important part of the american economy are made it does create uncertainty for many businesses • the inability to face our fiscal reality is a concerni believe that if we had adopted some form of the simpsonbowles plan to fix the debt it would have been extremely beneficial to the economy • entitlement spending – which now is  of federal spending and is growing – is crowding out infrastructure spending and spending on initiatives like research and development and training • in addition uncertainty about the ulti mate outcome of the fed’s unconven tional qe policy and our inability to deal with some fiscal issues makes future fed policy more complicated • political gridlock resulting not only in our government shutdown but in two debt ceiling crises was damaging and irresponsible • us corporate tax policy is hugely ineffi cient and at the margin drives american capital overseas • us immigration policy which we should fix for moral reasons alone also is driving brains and entrepreneurs overseasmost economists think a good immigration policy could accelerate us economic growth by  right away and by  over a year periodthis alone could create  million jobsin addition uncertainty and hypersensitivity to risk may be holding back growth uncertainty also has always been a constant in businessbut coming out of a financial crisis in addition to the items i mentioned above we may be living in a time of height ened sensitivity uncertainty and risk aver sionit seems that just about everyone has become a risk expert and sees risk behind every rockthey don’t want to miss it – like they did inthey want to be able to say “i told you so” and therefore they identify everything as riskyhere are a few facts that support the uncertainty and risk aversion hypothesis • corporations seem unduly conservativewe already have mentioned how much excess cash they hold • us gross capital formation as a percentage of gdp has been at lower levels in the last five years than it has been for more than  yearscapital expenditures ultimately are the drivers of productivity jobs and growth • the top  companies account for approximately  of all capital expen dituresone reason that large companies may be more conservative in their use of cash and debt is that rating agencies are much tougher on ratingsin  the number of aaa and aa issuers was  and in  that number wastoday the companies are bigger basic financial metrics ie debt to equity and margins essentially are the same and defaults are loweri have defended the rating agencies’ right to their opinions but it seems they also may have largely overreacted to the financial crisis • finally one of the great aspects of the american system is that it is okay to fail and to try againbut even that seems to be diminishing as failure other than in silicon valley is severely punishedthis all can be fixed there is nothing in all of the negative items that i mentioned above that can’t be fixed through our own actionscollaboration as opposed to destructive fingerpointing is neededa few smart decisions and a lot of   constructive collaboration will improve confi dence – and confidence is the “secret sauce” of growthas consumers and businesses grow more confident they will spend more and invest morestronger economic growth will create more jobs and higher incomes and give us the necessary resources to tackle pressing and important issues like inner city school education income inequality and proper infrastructure investingthe impact of tapering today there is hyperfocus on central bank policy and in particular on what’s called “fed tapering” the usfederal reserve had been buying  billion a month in treasuries and mortgage securities it recently reduced that amount to  billion a monthmost observers expect that number to come down to zero by the end of the yeareventually the fed may need to begin selling some of the securities it has purchasedthe fed’s balance sheet has gone from  tril lion in  to an estimated  trillion by the end of this yearsome feel the fed’s qe poli cies have been too aggressive and ultimately will be inflationaryadditionally there is a fear that ending qe will be risky and complex particularly since qe has little precedencewe cannot predict the future and it is rational to have a healthy fear of new and untested policieshowever we think it will be helpful to put some of these issues in perspective tooput it in perspective the value of all financial assets in america today is approximately  trillionwhen the fed stops buying securities the  trillion it owns will run off to  trillion by  simply from paydowns of principal in treasuries and mortgageswhile it is not clear what the new steady state will be – the fed probably will not need to take its balance sheet all the way back down to  trillioneven if the fed eventually needs to sell some securities the american economy should be able to handle it easily – particularly in a strong economythis unconventional monetary policy qe may have worked but it is confusing figuring out the full effect of qe is hard to doand therefore figuring out the effect of the reversal of qe is even harder to doqe replaced  trillion in treasuries and mortgage securities held by individuals investors funds and others with cash reserves created by the fedif all that might happen is the various investors involved took the cash and deposited it at a bank and the bank in turn deposited it at the fed there essentially would be no real change in economic effectbut if those involved spent the money bought additional stocks or bonds and invested in longterm assets there would be an effect on the real economythere is little question that qe – because it drove longterm rates down – lifted asset prices including stocks and home prices there were other global effects but i won’t talk about them here reduced funding costs improved economic activity and helped the economy recoverthis probably was more true early on with qe and less true later onbut much of qe appeared to be “unused” at the end of  before qe started banks had  trillion in deposits  trillion in loans and only  billion in deposits at the fedtoday banks have  trillion in deposits  trillion in loans and  tril lion in deposits at the fedyou can see that loans increased very little while deposits and reserves at the fed increased dramaticallybanks clearly did not use all of these addi tional deposits to make more loans though this was due to several factors including the weak economy and the banks’ need to build up their capital and liquidity ratiosone concern is that this “unused” money will one day be aggressively used – and cause too much inflationthe fed has tools in place to reverse qe if necessary — and banks have more constraints in lending out the money anyway the fed has many tools to reverse qe if necessary which it can readily use if too much credit is created in the systemhowever banks will be far more constrained in how much they can lend than in the past because of the new higher liquidity and  regardless of what those receiving cash for their securities did with the cash it ultimately will end up back in the banking system in the form of deposits both at the bank and therefore deposits at the fedthe deposits at the fed are called reserves   capital requirementsin the new regulatory environment the transmission and effect of monetary policy by the fed will be different from the way it was in the pastit is very hard to calculate this impact although i’m sure the fed is taking it into considerationin addition business financing needs are likely to be moderate because businesses will be able to fund many of their projects with their own excess cash and strong earningsnormalization is a good thing ultimately a normalization of interest rates capital flow and allocation without central bank interference concurrent with a strengthening economy has to be a good thing – something that we all eventually should want even though it probably will be accompanied by volatile movements in interest rateswhen rates do normalize we know one thing for certain – it will happen differently from what people expectand my guess is that when it happens it will be faster than people expecta normalized interest rate curve might have shortterm interest rates at  and year treasury bond rates at  plus or minusif the yield curve returns to those kinds of levels in a healthy economy we all will be okayand the fed already has made it absolutely clear that it will normalize its monetary policy only as the economy strengthensfocus on the real economy vs the money economy the real us economy includes  million people who get up and go to work every day trying to improve their lives and the lives of their family and counter to what you read in the newspapers  of those people are happy with their jobthe real economy includes millions of companies serving clients every day and generally building to expand and meet their customers’ order flowsin fact most people in the real economy appropriately pay very little atten tion to the money economyi would remind our readers that there are  million ameri cans but only a small fraction watch cnbc or read the wall street journalin the real economy what matters to most people is one’s family job and quality of lifethose of us who operate in the money economy are very sensitive to interest rates – maybe overly sensitiveand we should look through the volatility at interest rates which will almost definitely be there as the fed changes its policyvolatility in interest rates will not necessarily dampen real growth in the real economyrising interest rates all things being equal will be a big plus for your company even as we have grown deposits and market share in many of our businesses profit margins have been squeezed because of abnormally low interest ratesif interest rates rise to the normalized scenario that i described earlier our net interest margins could expand  increasing our net interest income and profits by approximately  billion aftertax all things being equalthis of course would take place over three to five years and not in a straight linebut indeed all things are not equal – many other factors will have an impact on our business flows and resultswe have been vigilant in trying to analyze the effect of interest rates on interest margins we have managed the balance sheet to benefit from rising interest rates and we also have been vigilant in trying to predict the effect of interest rates and fed mone tary policy on deposit flowsthere is little question that the fed’s qe policy increased deposits substantially and that as qe is reversed it will reduce depositsit is possible that we could see significant outflows of certain types of deposits over the years – an event for which we will be preparedbanks still need to be there in good times and in bad times — but it will be a little harder in the new world in the last financial crisis many banks stood against the tidethey were there for their clients and continued to fund busi nesses cities schools hospitals and invest ments when many other banks wouldn’t or couldn’t do soit is not because these banks were irrational but because that is their jobimagine yourself being a client of a bank and at the first sign of trouble the bank runs like a rabbit   the money markets and some of the capital markets are like rabbits – at the first sign of trouble they run as far and as fast as they canhuman psychology isn’t going to change and even the fed can only mitigate the effect of this reactionit is quite possible that some shadow banks will act that way – they may make loans only in good times but not in bad timesso when the regulators finish designing the new system they should try to keep this in mindmany of the new rules have added procy clicalityfor example basel iii capital rules require that riskweighted assets will go up in a stressed environmentwe estimate that between  to  of our capital may be used in an extreme stressed environment to satisfy additional regulatory requirements and this will force us more quickly and more aggressively to reduce or not add to risk assets as the stressed environment unfoldsand the new liquidity rules require us to hold  of liquid assets against possible outflowsso as a crisis unfolds by definition we will have outflows higher than expected that will require more liquid assetsthis will require the selling of risky assets to buy liquid assetswe hope the regulators will come up with a schematic that allows the use of liquid assets in stressed times without penalty so that banks can continue to lend when times are toughwe certainly don’t want to have liquidity or capital rules aggravating a crisisand we have many exciting new things coming we have focused a lot of attention in this letter on the new rules and regulations and on many issues about which we need to be worriedbut there still are a lot of initiatives and innovative new products and services coming down the pike about which we are excitedi’d like to mention just a few of them • better client data management leading to deeper penetrationin all of our businesses we are building better client data manage ment systemsthis gives us a deeper under standing of our clients and better coordina tion of our selling effortsthis allows us to more effectively sell additional products to the same customers – which helps drive both profitability and customer satisfaction • increasing segmentation and focus on more refined market segmentsfor example this includes advertising and products specifi cally designed for market segments like retirees women and certain minority groupsour commercial bank has formed specialty lending departments so that as a whole this line of business has deep exper tise about particular industriesand our mobile banking products will be specifically designed for different market segmentseven in areas where we already are ranked  like fixed income sales and trading when you dig deeper there still is a lot of room for improvement in certain parts of the world and in certain subbusinesses and products • an exceptional customer experiencewe have been on this journey for a while and we are getting better but there is so much more to dowe want to be known for our customer service – and we want to be compared in this regard with the best in the business • jpmorganchase institutewe are going to form a thoughtleading institute backed by all of the knowledge broad relation ships and resources across the firm to help continue to educate the world on topics in which jpmorganchase has a distinct and deep knowledgewe intend to analyze and publish our insights on small middlesized and large businesses the development of cities and communities global trade and capital flows and workforce development among other themes • big datawe have created a highpowered group of experts to enhance our use of data generated across jpmorganchase or purchased externally to create intelli gent solutions for our clientsfor example we are looking at our data assets to help clients in managing collateral positions assist merchants in gaining insights and aid consumers in validating credit reports among othersthis group will have an unending supply of work • chasenetwe announced this initiative last yearit allows us to rethink the whole endtoend payment experience for both  the role of banks in developing society at jpmorganchase we believe we have a responsibility to be part of the solution to the world’s most pressing problems not only because it’s the right thing to do but because our own longterm success depends on the success of our communities and the people companies and institutions we

daily about how hard it is to find workers with the right skillssome  million jobs stand open while  million americans remain unemployed and millions more have given up seeking employmentthat’s why we launched new skills at work an unprecedented  million fiveyear private sector initiative to improve job training at the middleskill level for jobs that require training beyond high school but not a fouryear degreethe sense of urgency to address this issue is something we see everywhere we do business and we are working with community leaders across the country — community colleges technical training programs policymakers and employers — to tackle the skills gapwe know that helping workers gain the skills they need is only one part of the solution to the unemployment challenge but it is an area we can do something about right nowand jpmorganchase is uniquely suited to the task of rallying a broad range of business leaders around the goal of aligning our investments in education and skills training with current job openings and future career pathways  consumers and merchantswe now have several clients on a beta test and we are hoping to roll out some exciting programs that are

banking   it is important to acknowledge that no matter how good one’s position is no one has a divine right to successmany of you have seen companies in extraordinary positions erode over timesometimes this happens because of structural or technological changes but frequently it happens because of plain and simple mismanagementand this is even more true when you operate in tough complex competitive and sometimes volatile global marketsso to succeed long term we need an excellent management teamand in my opinion your management team has the character culture intellect experience and wisdom necessary to succeedand importantly this management team does not rest on its laurels and is continually questioning itself and often focusing not on what we do well but on what we have not done wellyears ago the us military adopted a review process called the after action reviews aaran aar is a disciplined process where military leaders review the results of all missions takenthis examination is conducted not so the commanders in charge can find faults and point fingers – but so everyone can continually get betterat our company we have the same attitude and just hope that we can do it half as well as the us militaryin closing i want to reiterate how honored i am to work at this company and with its peoplewhat they have accomplished during these difficult

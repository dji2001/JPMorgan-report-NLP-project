Dear Fellow Shareholders,
Across the globe, 2022 was another year of significant challenges: from a terrible 
war in Ukraine and growing geopolitical tensions — particularly with China — to a 
politically divided America. Almost all nations felt the effects of global economic 
uncertainty, including higher energy and food prices, mounting inflation rates 
and volatile markets, and, of course, COVID-19’s lingering impacts. While all these 
experiences and associated turmoil have serious ramifications on our company, 
colleagues, clients and the countries in which we do business, their consequences 
on the world at large — with the extreme suffering of the Ukrainian people and 
the potential restructuring of the global order — are far more important. 
As these events unfold, America remains divided within its borders, and its  
global leadership role is being challenged outside of its borders. Nevertheless, 
this is the moment when we should put aside our differences and work with other 
Western nations to come together in defense of democracy and essential

freedoms, including free enterprise. During other times of great crisis, we have 
seen America, in partnership with other countries around the globe, unite for a 
common cause. This is that moment again, when our country needs to work 
across public and private sectors to lead while improving American competitiveness 
— which also means re-establishing the American promise of providing equal 
access to opportunity for all. JPMorgan Chase, a company that historically has 
worked across borders and boundaries, will do its part to ensure the global 
economy is safe and secure. 
In spite of the unsettling landscape, 2022 was somewhat surprisingly another 
strong year for JPMorgan Chase, with the firm generating record revenue for  
the fifth year in a row, as well as setting numerous records in each of our lines  
of business. We earned revenue in 2022 of $132.3 billion1 and net income of  
$37.7 billion, with return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) of 18%, reflecting 
strong underlying performance across our businesses. We also maintained our 
quarterly common dividend of $1.00 per share and continued to reinforce our 
fortress balance sheet. We grew market share in several of our businesses and 
continued to make significant investments in products, people and technology 
while exercising strict credit discipline. In total, we extended credit and raised 
capital of $2.4 trillion for our consumer and institutional clients around the world. 
I remain proud of our company’s resiliency and of what our hundreds of thousands 
of employees around the world have achieved, collectively and individually. 
Throughout these challenging past few years, we never stopped doing all the 
things we should be doing to serve our clients and our communities. 
Adhering to our basic principles and strategies (see sidebar on Steadfast 
Principles on page 5) allows us to drive good organic growth and properly 
manage our capital (including dividends and stock buybacks), as we have

consistently demonstrated for decades. Our performance results are shown in 
the charts on pages 6-12, which illustrate how we have grown our franchises, 
how we compare with our competitors and how we look at our fortress balance 
sheet. I invite you to peruse them at your leisure. In addition, I urge you to read 
the CEO letters in this Annual Report, which will give you more specific details 
about our businesses and our plans for the future. 
As you know, we are champions of banking’s essential role in a community —  
its potential for bringing people together, for enabling companies and individuals 
to attain their goals, and for being a source of strength in difficult times. As  
I often remind our employees, the work we do matters and has impact. We help 
people and institutions finance and achieve their aspirations, lifting up 
individuals, homeowners, small businesses, larger corporations, schools, 
hospitals, cities and countries in all regions of the world.

STEADFAST PRINCIPLES WORTH REPEATING
Looking back on the past two+ decades — 
starting from my time as CEO of Bank One 
in 2000 — there is one common theme: 
our unwavering dedication to help clients, 
communities and countries throughout 
the world. It is clear that our financial dis-
cipline, constant investment in innovation 
and ongoing development of our people 
are what enabled us to achieve this con-
sistency and commitment. In addition, 
across the firm, we uphold certain stead-
fast tenets that are worth repeating. 
First, our work has very real human 
impact. While JPMorgan Chase stock is 
owned by large institutions, pension 
plans, mutual funds and directly by single 
investors, in almost all cases the ultimate 
beneficiaries are individuals in our com-
munities. More than 100 million people in 
the United States own stock; many, in one 
way or another, own JPMorgan Chase 
stock. Frequently, these shareholders are 
veterans, teachers, police officers, fire-
fighters, healthcare workers, retirees or 
those saving for a home, education or 
retirement. Often, our employees also 
bank these shareholders, as well as their 
families and their companies. Your man-
agement team goes to work every day 
recognizing the enormous responsibility 
that we have to all of our shareholders. 
Second, shareholder value can be built 
only if you maintain a healthy and vibrant 
company, which means doing a good job 
of taking care of your customers, employ-
ees and communities. Conversely, how 
can you have a healthy company if you 
neglect any of these stakeholders? As  
we have learned over the past few years, 
there are myriad ways an institution  
can demonstrate its compassion for its 
employees and its communities while still 
upholding shareholder value.
this letter. We recognize our strengths and 
vulnerabilities, and we play our hand as 
best we can.
Sixth, we operate with a very important 
silent partner — the U.S. government — 
noting as my friend Warren Buffett points 
out that his company’s success is predi-
cated upon the extraordinary conditions 
our country creates. He is right to say to 
his shareholders that when they see the 
American flag, they all should say thank 
you. We should, too. JPMorgan Chase is a 
healthy and thriving company, and we 
always want to give back and pay our fair 
share. We do pay our fair share — and we 
want it to be spent well and have the 
greatest impact. To give you an idea of 
where our taxes and fees go: In the last  
10 years, we paid more than $43 billion in 
federal, state and local taxes in the United 
States and almost $19 billion in taxes out-
side of the United States. We also paid the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
over $10 billion so that it has the resources 
to cover failure in the American banking 
sector. Our partner — the federal govern-
ment — also imposes significant regula-
tions upon us, and it is imperative that we 
meet all legal and regulatory requirements 
imposed on our company. 
Seventh and finally, we know the founda-
tion of our success rests with our people. 
They are the frontline, both individually 
and as teams, serving our customers and 
communities, building the technology, 
making the strategic decisions, managing 
the risks, determining our investments 
and driving innovation. However you view 
the world — its complexity, risks and 
opportunities — a company’s prosperity 
requires a great team of people with guts, 
brains, integrity, enormous capabilities 
and high standards of professional excel-
lence to ensure its ongoing success.
Third, while we don’t run the company 
worrying about the stock price in the 
short run, in the long run we consider 
our stock price a measure of our prog-
ress over time. This progress is a func-
tion of continual investments in our 
people, systems and products, in good 
and bad times, to build our capabilities. 
These important investments will also 
drive our company’s future prospects 
and position it to grow and prosper for 
decades. Measured by stock perfor-
mance, our progress is exceptional.  
For example, whether looking back  
10 years or even farther to 2004, when 
the JPMorgan Chase/Bank One merger 
took place, we have significantly out-
performed the Standard & Poor’s 500 
Index and the Standard & Poor’s Finan-
cials Index. 
Fourth, we are united behind basic prin-
ciples and strategies (you can see the 
How We Do Business principles on our 
website) that have helped build this 
company and made it thrive — from 
maintaining a fortress balance sheet, 
constantly investing and nurturing tal-
ent to fully satisfying regulators, contin-
ually improving risk, governance and 
controls, and serving customers and  
clients while lifting up communities 
worldwide. This philosophy is embedded 
in our company culture and influences 
nearly every role in the firm. 
Fifth, we strive to build enduring busi-
nesses, which rely on and benefit from 
one another, but we are not a conglomer-
ate. This structure helps generate our 
superior returns. Nonetheless, despite 
our best efforts, the walls that protect 
this company are not particularly high — 
and we face extraordinary competition.  
I have written about this reality exten-
sively in the past and cover it again in

An important note to describe why we are showing the table above: The loan loss reserve 
accounting rules — which are life-of-loan estimated losses based upon probability-based economic 
scenarios — generate huge swings in earnings that can be unrelated to actual credit performance. 
This was particularly true for the COVID-19 years when, during the first six months of the pandemic, 
we built approximately $16 billion in reserves. Then in the next six quarters, we released essentially 
the equivalent number. We did so only because the scenarios used to estimate future credit losses 
changed dramatically.
The table above shows reported net income, with and without loan loss reserve changes.  
Throughout this period, the credit portfolio was healthy, and charge-offs remained below  
pre-pandemic levels. Either way, the company had strong absolute and relative performance.

Why We Are Proud of 
JPMorgan Chase
Our vision is simple and unchanged: We aim to be 
the most respected financial services firm in the 
world, serving corporations and individuals. To 
that end, it is imperative that we run a healthy, 
vibrant and responsible company. In addition to 
traditional banking, we do a lot to help the com-
munities in which we operate, which, in turn, pro-
vides the foundation for increased opportunity and 
prosperity for all. And just to note, while we are 
proud of the good things we do every day, we are 
also an organization that acknowledges the mis-
takes we make along the way, which is important 
to do. And when we do make mistakes, we own up 
to them, learn from them and then move on. 
UNITED BY PRINCIPLES AND PURPOSE
We’ve always had — and published — principles to 
guide how we do business, with values embedded 
within them, which I described in the preceding 
section. These tenets unite our company across 
the globe. To complement these guidelines, we 
recently developed a clearly stated purpose — 
Make dreams possible for everyone, everywhere, 
every day — to knit together our values with our 
everyday business principles and explain how we 
have done business for years. 
While our company has a rich history, is proud of 
the critical role it plays in powering economic 
growth and has done exceptionally well over the 
past 200 years, research has shown that pur-
pose-driven companies achieve stronger business 
results and have greater impact by doing better for 
their customers, employees and shareholders. Our 
intention in documenting our purpose for ourselves 
is to help energize our employees, differentiate our 
company from our competitors, and push our orga-
nization to innovate on behalf of our clients, col-
leagues and communities. In addition, we are 
launching a new effort — internally and externally 
— to showcase how the work we do matters and has 
tangible impact locally and around the world. 
In detailing the elements of our purpose, shown in 
the following sidebar, we have tried to make every 
word meaningful.

WHY WE ARE PROUD OF JPMORGAN CHASE 
We are also dedicated to corporate responsibility, 
and our efforts extend far beyond significant phil-
anthropic contributions (which total more than 
$350 million a year globally). For example, at the 
local level, we support educational institutions and 
work-skills training programs around the world, as 
well as finance affordable housing and small busi-
nesses. In addition, we help formulate broad-
based policies that are good for countries on 
issues such as healthcare, infrastructure, educa-
tion and employment. Sometimes we promote spe-
cific initiatives; for example, programs that help 
individuals with a criminal background get a sec-
ond chance. Lest anyone think that I’ve become a 
little soft, rest assured your CEO is a red-blooded, 
patriotic, free-enterprise and free-market capital-
ist (properly regulated, of course) and finds noth-
ing inconsistent with the multifaceted ways we use 
our capabilities to lift up our communities.
Part of our corporate responsibility efforts are 
focused on progress toward diversity, equity and 
inclusion (DEI), which is detailed in the sidebar 
below. And the sidebar on pages 18 and 19 shows 
how our work on the ground translates to a partic-
ular geography, in this case the state of Ohio.
HIGHLIGHTING OUR DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION EFFORTS
We seek to create a company that reflects the 
diverse communities that we serve, a workplace  
in which all employees feel they belong and are 
respected. We believe these efforts not only make 
us a positive work environment, but they also 
make our company stronger, our business more 
profitable and our institution a better global cor-
porate citizen. This objective is integrated into how 
we do business every day. Some of our recent 
progress is highlighted below:
• We continue to identify ways to support our  
military veterans. In 2011, along with 10 other 
companies, JPMorgan Chase co-founded the  
Veteran Jobs Mission (VJM), a coalition commit-
ted to hiring at least 100,000 veterans by 2020. 
Since its founding, more than 300 member com-
panies representing various industries across 
the United States have reported over 880,000 
veteran hires. In 2022, VJM increased its goal  
to 2 million veteran hires and 200,000 military 
spouse hires over the next decade. JPMorgan 
Chase alone has hired over 18,000 veterans 
since 2011 and currently employs approximately 
3,000 military spouses.
• We continue to make strides in developing a 
diversified workplace. By year-end, women rep-
resented 49% of the firm’s total workforce. Over-
all, Hispanic, Asian and Black representation 
grew to 21%, 18% and 14%, respectively. In 2022, 
the number of employees who self-identified  
as LGBTQ+ increased by 35% year-over-year,  
following 50% year-over-year growth in 2021.
• The firm’s Office of Disability Inclusion (ODI) con-
tinues to lead strategy and initiatives aimed at 
advancing careers while helping the firm be a 
bank of choice for people with disabilities. As 
ODI kicked off its business growth and entrepre-
neurship work in 2022, it provided business 
coaching to over 225 entrepreneurs with  
disabilities and commissioned research with  
the National Disability Institute, which identified 
unique opportunities and challenges among 
small business owners who have a disability.
An update on our $30 billion racial equity 
commitment
What began in 2020 as a $30 billion, five-year 
commitment is now transforming into a consistent 
business practice that our lines of business deliver 
each day to support Black, Hispanic, Latino and 
other underserved communities.
By the end of 2022, we reported nearly $29 billion 
in progress toward our original goal. But our 
focus is not on how much money is deployed —  
it is on long-term impact and outcomes. 
16
WHY WE ARE PROUD OF JPMORGAN CHASE 
Here are some details on our program’s progress 
through 2022: 
• Supplier diversity. In 2022, our firm spent 
approximately $2.1 billion directly with diverse 
suppliers — an increase of 25% over 2021. As a 
part of our racial equity commitment, $400  
million was spent in 2022 with over 200 Black-, 
Hispanic- and Latino-owned businesses — more 
than doubling the amount spent in 2021. 
• Affordable rental housing. Through our  
Affordable Housing Preservation program, we 
approved funding of approximately $18 billion in 
loans to incentivize the preservation of nearly 
170,000 affordable housing rental units across 
the United States. Additionally, we financed 
approximately $4 billion for the construction 
and rehabilitation of affordable rental housing. 
• Homeownership. In a rising rate environment, 
we continue our efforts to provide homeowner-
ship opportunities for Black, Hispanic and Latino 
households across all income levels, including 
advocating for policies that reduce barriers to 
owning a home. The biggest barriers are upfront 
cash for a down payment and closing costs.  
In 2022, we expanded our $5,000 Chase Home-
buyer Grant program to include over 11,000 
majority Black, Hispanic and Latino communi-
ties. Since our grant program began in 2021,  
we have provided about 2,700 grants totaling 
$13.5 million. We have also assisted Black,  
Hispanic and Latino homeowners with 11,500 
incremental home loans together worth over  
$4 billion, mainly driven by refinance activity 
when rates were low. 
• Small business. In 2022, we launched a Special 
Purpose Credit Program, the first of its kind 
nationally, to expand credit access for small busi-
nesses in majority Black, Hispanic and Latino 
communities, which have traditionally been 
underserved. When I visited Houston last year,  
I met Sherice and Steve Garner, Chase customers 
who own a local barbecue business, Southern Q. 
They are examples of the types of customers we 
want to support. Previously, they had been using 
their personal bank account to run their busi-
ness. We helped them secure a small business 
loan to purchase their business location. To 
assist more families like the Garners, we hired  
45 local senior business consultants to provide 
one-on-one coaching and host educational 
events, community workshops and business 
training seminars to support minority entrepre-
neurs across 21 U.S. cities. 
• Minority depository institutions (MDI) and 
community development financial institutions 
(CDFI). We invested more than $100 million in 
equity in diverse financial institutions and pro-
vided over $200 million in incremental financing 
to CDFIs to support communities that lack access 
to traditional financing. We also helped them 
build their capacity so they can provide a 
greater number of critical services like mort-
gages and small business loans. Additionally,  
we do not charge a fee for nearly all our partici-
pating MDI and CDFI customers who make a 
withdrawal at a Chase ATM.
• Access to banking. We helped more than 
400,000 customers open low-cost checking 
accounts; we’ve also opened 13 Community Center 
branches (a total of 15 Community Center 
branches since 2019), often in areas with larger 
Black, Hispanic and Latino populations; and we 
hired over 140 Community Managers in under-
served communities to build relationships with 
community leaders, nonprofits and small busi-
nesses. These Community Center branches are 
unique spaces in the heart of urban communi-
ties with more space than standard bank 
branches to host local events, small business 
mentoring sessions and financial health semi-
nars. The majority were built with minority  
contractors from the community; we hire staff 
locally and we engage local artists to help 
ensure these locations complement their neigh-
borhood. We have been pleased by the dramatic 
positive effect these specialized branches have 
had on their communities to date and expect to 
expand the program.
By driving inclusive economic growth, we can help 
create a brighter future for all, no matter where 
people live or the circumstances they’re born into. 
We provide regular updates on our corporate web-
site about our progress toward equity and equal-
ity, and I encourage you to read about the mean-
ingful impact we’re making within our firm and 
with the people we serve.

WHY WE ARE PROUD OF JPMORGAN CHASE 
THE STATE OF OHIO: HOW JPMORGAN CHASE DRIVES  
COMMUNITY GROWTH 
Our support to local financial firms:
• We have provided nearly $20 billion in credit  
and capital over the last five years for financial 
institutions such as local banks, insurance  
companies, asset managers and securities firms. 
• Importantly, we bank 19 of Ohio’s regional, 
midsized and community banks, helping them 
serve local communities and accomplish their 
other goals. 
Our support to small businesses: 
• By the end of 2022, loan balances for small  
business customers in Ohio totaled over $800 
million — funds being used to run and grow  
companies and create jobs. 
— Includes support for distribution of the  
federal government’s Paycheck Protection  
Program (PPP) to help small businesses  
navigate the pandemic in 2020 and 2021
• In 2022 alone, JPMorgan Chase helped over 
160,000 small businesses thrive and grow through 
access to customers, capital and networks, giving 
us the second largest business banking market 
share in the state. We also offered some 106,000 
hours of advice and support to small businesses.
Our support to consumer banking needs:
• We operate nearly 225 branches and over  
530 ATMs across the state. 
• To help Ohioans build wealth and be financially 
healthy, we have provided more than 4 million 
savings, checking and credit card accounts, 
enabling these consumers to gain access to 
resources such as free financial health services, 
as well as mortgage and auto loans. 
— Ranked as the second largest provider of  
consumer banking in Ohio with over 2 million 
checking and savings accounts and customer 
deposits totaling nearly $37 billion in 2022
• In 2022, we oversaw more than $20 billion in 
investment and annuity assets for clients. 
When JPMorgan Chase does business in a commu-
nity, we do more than just open branches. We lend 
to small, midsized and big businesses; we hire, pay 
well and provide great benefits; and we finance 
hospitals, schools, grocery stores, homes, automo-
biles and governments. For more than 200 years, 
this approach has enabled us to make investments 
that have a lasting impact on local economies, 
families and neighborhoods while also supporting 
them in good and challenging times. 
We have been in Ohio since 1812, and our experi-
ence there serves as a great example of how our 
resources drive growth on the ground. 
Our support to government, higher education, 
healthcare and nonprofit organizations: 
• We serve approximately 150 government, higher 
education, healthcare and nonprofit clients 
throughout the state, and over the last five 
years, we provided nearly $9 billion in credit and 
capital to them. 
• Our clients range from University Hospitals 
Health System, Inc. to the Ronald McDonald 
House in Columbus and the University of Dayton 
in Dayton. 
• We are the primary treasury bank for Ohio State 
University and the primary bank for the city of 
Columbus; we also bank nearly 50 counties,  
cities and school districts across the state. 
Our support to investment and middle market 
banking clients:
• Our support includes $120 billion in credit and 
capital over the last five years for Commercial & 
Industrial clients such as energy, retail and auto 
businesses. 
• We have over 4,800 large and midsized clients in 
Ohio, up over 70% compared with 2019, which 
also includes emerging middle market companies 
owned by veterans, women, LGBTQ+ individuals 
and people of color. This gives us leading market 
shares in the state compared with other banks.

WHY WE ARE PROUD OF JPMORGAN CHASE 
Our business and community investments:
• The firm’s national $30 billion racial equity  
commitment takes place very specifically on  
the ground. Since the program began, we have 
committed more than $260 million across the 
state, including:
— Over $163 million in loans for Black, Hispanic 
and Latino households to purchase or refi-
nance a home 
— $54 million financed through investments and 
loans for the construction and rehabilitation 
of affordable housing 
— $14 million in New Markets Tax Credit invest-
ments to support the Ronald McDonald House 
Charities in central Ohio
— Over $12 million spent with Black, Hispanic 
and Latino suppliers 
• We’ve committed $45 million in philanthropic 
support across the state since 2018 such as: 
— $5 million to support The 614 for Linden, a 
CDFI and nonprofit collaborative, in Columbus, 
which helped catalyze a $20 million fund for 
affordable housing; create or preserve nearly 
750 affordable housing units; provide 57 
microloans to local entrepreneurs; support 
technical assistance for over 100 small busi-
nesses; and increase wraparound services for 
prenatal care, as well as facilitate access to 
healthy food
Our impact as a proud employer in Ohio:
• Today, as the largest private employer in  
Columbus, JPMorgan Chase employs over 
20,000 Ohioans throughout the state,  
including more than 2,000 veterans and  
500 people with a criminal background  
who deserve a second chance. 
• We also support an additional 3,200 jobs for 
contractors in our branches and corporate 
offices across the state.
• In Ohio, our average salary is $96,000, not 
including benefits. Our lowest starting wage is 
$41,000 (plus a comprehensive annual benefits 
package worth nearly $15,000) compared with 
Ohio’s average salary of $35,0001.

WHY WE ARE PROUD OF JPMORGAN CHASE 
Update on Specific Issues Facing 
Our Company
CLIMATE COMPLEXITY AND PLANNING 
The window for action to avert the costliest 
impacts of global climate change is closing. At the 
same time, the ongoing war in Ukraine is roiling 
trade relations across Europe and Asia and rede-
fining the way countries and companies plan for 
energy security. The need to provide energy 
affordably and reliably for today, as well as make 
the necessary investments to decarbonize for 
tomorrow, underscores the inextricable links 
between economic growth, energy security and  
climate change. We need to do more, and we need 
to do so immediately. 
To expedite progress, governments, businesses 
and non-governmental organizations need to align 
across a series of practical policy changes that 
comprehensively address fundamental issues that 
are holding us back. Massive global investment in 
clean energy technologies must be done and must 
continue to grow year-over-year. 
At the same time, permitting reforms are desper-
ately needed to allow investment to be done in any 
kind of timely way. We may even need to evoke 
eminent domain — we simply are not getting the 
adequate investments fast enough for grid, solar, 
wind and pipeline initiatives. Policies like the  
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Creating Helpful 
Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and 
Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) — 
that hold the potential to unlock over $1 trillion in 
clean technology development — need to be imple-
mented effectively. The upside is undeniable: Wide-
spread investing across the private sector will aid 
domestic manufacturing, invigorate research and 
development in green innovation, help create resil-
ient supply chains, lift up local economies and build 
the U.S. clean energy workforce by up to 9 million 
jobs over the next decade. While major advances 
have been made in the last few years on technology 
to help this cause, we are hopeful that the great 
American innovation machine (most advancements 
will ultimately come from the huge capabilities and 
capital of America’s largest companies) will find the 
additional technologies that are desperately 
needed. There is a downside — massive, inefficient 
and malinvestment of capital. I talk more about this 
in the last section on public policy.
Polarization, paralysis and basic lack of analysis 
cannot keep us from addressing one of the most 
complex challenges of our time. Diverse stakehold-
ers need to come together, seeking the best 
answers through engagement around our common 
interest. Bolstering growth must go hand in hand 
with both securing an energy future and meeting 
science-based climate targets for future 
generations.  
AI, DATA AND OUR JOURNEY TO THE 
CLOUD 
Artificial intelligence (AI) is an extraordinary and 
groundbreaking technology. AI and the raw  
material that feeds it, data, will be critical to our 
company’s future success — the importance of 
implementing new technologies simply cannot be 
overstated. We already have more than 300 AI 
use cases in production today for risk, prospect-
ing, marketing, customer experience and fraud 
prevention, and AI runs throughout our payments 
processing and money movement systems across 
the globe. AI has already added significant value 
to our company. For example, in the last few 
years, AI has helped us to significantly decrease 
risk in our retail business (by reducing fraud and 
illicit activity) and improve trading optimization 
and portfolio construction (by providing optimal 
execution strategies, automating forecasting and 
analytics, and improving client intelligence).
We currently have over 1,000 people involved in 
data management, more than 900 data scientists 
(AI and machine learning (ML) experts who create 
new models) and 600 ML engineers (who write the 
code to put models in production). This group is 
20
UPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY
focused on AI and ML across natural language  
processing, time series analysis and reinforcement 
learning to name a few. We’re imagining new ways 
to augment and empower employees with AI 
through human-centered collaborative tools and 
workflow, leveraging tools like large language 
models, including ChatGPT. 
We also have a 200-person, top-notch AI research 
group looking at the hardest problems and new 
frontiers in finance. We were recently ranked #1 on 
the Evident AI Index, the first public benchmark of 
major banks on their AI maturity. We take the 
responsible use of AI very seriously and have an 
interdisciplinary team of ethicists helping us prevent 
unintended misuse, anticipate regulation, and pro-
mote trust with our clients, customers and commu-
nities. AI and data use is complex; it must be done 
following the laws of the land. But it is an absolute 
necessity that we do it both for the benefits I just 
described and, equally, for the protection of the 
company and the financial system — because you 
can be certain that the bad guys will be using it, too. 
All of our technology groups firmwide work 
together in a flywheel of innovation and deliver 
state-of-the-art improvements. We are proud that 
our AI teams have contributed top-quality novel 
research and compelling solutions that are trans-
forming more and more business cases every day.
AI is inextricably linked with cloud-based systems, 
whether public or private, and digital capabilities. 
Our company needs the cloud for its on-demand 
compute capacity, flexibility, extensibility and 
speed. Native cloud-based approaches will ulti-
mately be faster, cheaper and aligned with the 
newest AI techniques, and they will give us easy 
access to constantly evolving developer tools. 
We have spent over $2 billion building new, cloud-
based data centers and are working to modernize 
a significant portion of our applications (and their 
related databases) to run in both our public and 
private cloud environments. To date, we have 
migrated approximately 38% of our applications  
to the cloud, meaning over 50% of our application 
portfolio (this includes third-party, cloud-based 
applications) is running on modern environments. 
This journey to the cloud is hard work but neces-
sary. Unlocking the full potential of the cloud and 
nearly 550 petabytes of data will require replat-
forming (putting data in a cloud-eligible format) 
and refactoring (i.e., rewriting) approximately 
4,000 applications. This effort will involve not just 
the 57,000 employees we have in technology but 
the dedicated time of firmwide management teams 
to help in the process. 
BANKING TURMOIL AND REGULATORY 
GOALS 
The recent failures of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in 
the United States and Credit Suisse in Europe, and 
the related stress in the banking system, under-
score that simply satisfying regulatory require-
ments is not sufficient. Risks are abundant, and 
managing those risks requires constant and vigi-
lant scrutiny as the world evolves. Regarding the 
current disruption in the U.S. banking system, most 
of the risks were hiding in plain sight. Interest rate 
exposure, the fair value of held-to-maturity (HTM) 
portfolios and the amount of SVB’s uninsured 
deposits were always known — both to regulators 
and the marketplace. The unknown risk was that 
SVB’s over 35,000 corporate clients — and activity 
within them — were controlled by a small number 
of venture capital companies that moved their 
deposits in lockstep. 
It is unlikely that any recent change in regulatory 
requirements would have made a difference in 
what followed. Instead, the recent rapid rise of 
interest rates placed heightened focus on the 
potential for rapid deterioration of the fair value of 
HTM portfolios and, in this case, the lack of sticki-
ness of certain uninsured deposits. Ironically, 
banks were incented to own very safe government 
securities because they were considered highly liq-
uid by regulators and carried very low capital 
requirements. Even worse, the stress testing based 
on the scenario devised by the Federal Reserve 
Board (the Fed) never incorporated interest rates 
at higher levels. This is not to absolve bank man-
agement — it’s just to make clear that this wasn’t 
the finest hour for many players. All of these col-
liding factors became critically important when the 
marketplace, rating agencies and depositors 
focused on them. 
21
UPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY
As I write this letter, the current crisis is not yet 
over, and even when it is behind us, there will be 
repercussions from it for years to come. But 
importantly, recent events are nothing like what 
occurred during the 2008 global financial crisis 
(which barely affected regional banks). In 2008, 
the trigger was a growing recognition that $1 trillion 
of consumer mortgages were about to go bad — 
and they were owned by various types of entities 
around the world. At that time, there was enor-
mous leverage virtually everywhere in the finan-
cial system. Major investment banks, Fannie Mae 
and Freddie Mac, nearly all savings and loan insti-
tutions, off-balance sheet vehicles, AIG and banks 
around the world — all of them failed. This current 
banking crisis involves far fewer financial players 
and fewer issues that need to be resolved.
These failures were not good for banks of  
any size.
Any crisis that damages Americans’ trust in their 
banks damages all banks — a fact that was known 
even before this crisis. While it is true that this 
bank crisis “benefited” larger banks due to the 
inflow of deposits they received from smaller insti-
tutions, the notion that this meltdown was good 
for them in any way is absurd. 
Let’s be very thoughtful in our reaction to 
recent events.
While this crisis will pass, lessons will be learned, 
which will result in some changes to the regulatory 
system. However, it is extremely important that we 
avoid knee-jerk, whack-a-mole or politically moti-
vated responses that often result in achieving the 
opposite of what people intended. Now is the time 
to deeply think through and coordinate complex 
regulations to accomplish the goals we want,  
eliminating costly inefficiencies and contradictory 
policies. Very often, rules are put in place in one 
part of the framework without appreciating their 
consequences in combination with other regula-
tions. America has had, and continues to have,  
the best and most dynamic financial system in  
the world — from various types of investors to its 
banks, rule of law, investor protections, transpar-
ency, exchanges and other features. We do not 
want to throw the baby out with the bath water. 
We should have common goals on how we 
want the banking system to work. 
• We want to strengthen regional, midsized and 
community banks, which are essential to the 
American economic system. They fill a critical 
role in small communities, offering local knowl-
edge and local relationships that some large 
banks simply can’t provide — or can’t provide 
cost-effectively. Overall, we want to maintain  
the extraordinary strength this tiered system 
affords. JPMorgan Chase directly supports this 
goal as we are one of the largest bankers in 
America to regional and community banks. We 
bank approximately 350 of America’s 4,000+ 
banks across the country. This means we make 
loans to them or raise capital for them. In addi-
tion, we process payments for them, finance 
some of their mortgage activities, advise them 
on acquisitions, provide them with interest rate 
swaps and foreign exchange, and buy and sell 
securities for them. And we also finance their 
local communities (think hospitals, schools and 
larger companies) in ways they cannot. 
• We need large, complex banks to continue  
to play a critical role in the U.S. and global 
financial system. And we need to recognize that 
they do so in a way regional banks can’t. Large 
banks are complex not because they want to be 
but because they operate in complex global 
markets. Regional banks simply cannot manage 
the scale and complexity of transactions in 50 or 
60 countries around the world to help some of 
America’s best and largest companies accom-
plish their goals. Think of equity, debt, M&A, 
research, swaps, foreign exchange, large pay-
ments systems, global custody and so on. It 
takes a global workforce with deep expertise 
and significant capabilities to provide these ser-
vices. These large global banks finance not just 
the world’s largest companies but the world’s 
development institutions and even countries. 
Having some of the best large, complex banks in 
the world is essential to the success of America’s 
biggest companies, its economic system and its 
global competitiveness, which says nothing 
against the importance of having great midsized 
and community banks as well. And contrary to 
22
UPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY
what some say — to be safe, a global bank needs 
both huge economies of scale and the strength 
of diversified earnings streams.
• We should want a system in which a bank  
failure does not cause undue panic and finan-
cial harm. While you don’t want banks to fail all 
the time, it should be allowed to happen, and the 
resolution should follow a completely prescribed 
process. In almost all bank failures, uninsured 
deposits never resulted in lost money — but  
the very fear of loss can cause a run on any bank 
having characteristics similar to a bank that has 
failed. Resolution and recovery regulations did 
not work particularly well during the recent  
crisis — we should bring clarity and reassurance 
to both the unwinding process and measures to 
reduce the risk of additional bank runs. It should 
also be noted that banks pay for any bank failure 
(through fees paid to the Federal Deposit Insur-
ance Corporation) as they pay for the whole 
financial regulatory system. And yes, while these 
costs are ultimately passed on to their customers 
— that is true for all industries — the cost is just 
the price of implementing proper regulations.
• We want proper transparency and strong regu-
lations. However, it should be noted that regula-
tions, the supervisory regime and the resolution 
regime currently in place did not stop SVB and 
Signature Bank from failing — and from causing 
systemwide issues. We should not aim for a reg-
ulatory regime that eliminates all failure but one 
that reduces the chance of failure and the odds 
of contagion. We should carefully study why this 
particular situation happened but not overreact. 
Strong regulations should not only minimize 
bank failures but also help to maintain the 
strength of banks as both the guardians of the 
financial system and engines that finance the 
great American economic machine.
• We should want market makers to have the 
ability to effectively intermediate, particularly 
in difficult markets, with central banks only step-
ping in during exceptional situations. In the last 
few years, we have had many situations in which 
disruptions in the market were, in my opinion, 
largely caused by certain regulations that did 
not improve the safety of the market maker but, 
instead, damaged the safety of the whole sys-
tem. In addition, many of the new “shadow 
bank” market makers are fair-weather friends — 
they do not step in to help clients in tough times.
• We need banks to be there for their clients in 
tough times. And they have been. Banks can 
flex their capital and provide their clients with  
a lot of loans and liquidity when they really need 
it. For example, at the beginning of the COVID-19 
crisis in March 2020, banks deployed over $500 
billion in liquidity for clients and $500 billion in 
PPP loans — and this does not include banks’ 
share of the nearly $2 trillion in loans that 
entered forbearance. Banks also play a unique 
and fundamental role in the transmission of 
monetary policy because deposits in banks can 
be loaned out, effectively “creating” money. 
Some regulations and some accounting rules 
have become too procyclical and make it harder 
to do this.
• Regulation, particularly stress testing, should 
be more thoughtful and forward looking. It has 
become an enormous, mind-numbingly complex 
task about crossing t’s and dotting i’s. For exam-
ple, the Fed’s stress test focuses on only one sce-
nario, which is unlikely to happen. In fact, this 
may lull risk committee members at any institu-
tion into a false sense of security that the risks 
they are taking are properly vetted and can be 
easily handled. A less academic, more collabora-
tive reflection of possible risks that a bank faces 
would better inform institutions and their regula-
tors about the full landscape of potential risks. 
• We should decide a priori what should stay in 
the regulatory system and what shouldn’t. 
There are reasons for certain choices, and they 
should not be the accidental outcome of uncoor-
dinated decision making. Regulatory arbitrage is 
already forcing many activities, from certain 
types of lending to certain types of trading, out-
side the banking system. Among many questions 
that need definitive answers, a few big ones 
would be: Do you want the mortgage business, 
credit and market making, along with other 
essential financial services, inside the banking 
23
UPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY
system or outside of it? What would be the  
long-term effect of that choice? Under the new 
scheme, would nonbank credit-providing institu-
tions be able to provide credit when their clients 
need them the most? I personally doubt that 
many of them could.
• We need banks to be attractive investments.  
It is in the interest of the financial system that 
banks not become “un-investable” because of 
uncertainty around regulations that affect capi-
tal, profitability and long-term investing. Erratic 
stress test capital requirements and constant 
uncertainty around future regulations damage 
the banking system without making it safer. 
While it is perfectly reasonable that a bank 
refrain from stock buybacks, dividends or 
growth under certain circumstances, it would be 
far better for the entire banking system if these 
rules were clearly enumerated (i.e., stipulate 
that a bank needs to reduce its buybacks and 
dividend if they breach certain thresholds).  
If done properly, banking regulations could be cali-
brated — adding virtually no additional risk — to 
make it easier for banks to make loans, intermedi-
ate markets, finance the economy, manage a run 
on their bank and fail if need be. When it comes to 
political debate about banking regulations, there is 
little truth to the notion that regulations have been 
“loosened,” at least in the context of large banks. 
(To the contrary, our capital requirements have 
been increasing for years, as shown on the chart 
on page 12.) The debate should not always be about 
more or less regulation but about what mix of  
regulations will keep America’s banking system 
the best in the world, such as capital and leverage 
ratios, liquidity and what counts as liquidity, reso-
lution rules, deposit insurance, securitization, 
stress testing, proper usage of the discount win-
dow, tailoring and other requirements (including 
potential requirements on shadow banks). Because 
of the recent problems, we can add to this mix the 
review of concentrated customers, uninsured 
deposits and potential limitations on the use of 
HTM portfolios. Ideally, new rules and regulations 
would also make it easier for banks to provide 
credit in tougher times. 
ADJUSTING OUR STRATEGY TO THE NEW 
REGULATORY REALITY (BASEL III 
ENDGAME)
The Basel III Endgame (called Basel IV by some) — 
which, incredibly, has been nearly 10 years in the 
making — seems likely to increase, yet again, capi-
tal requirements for banks in general, through 
higher operational risk changes, and for trading 
and capital markets activity in particular, among 
other things. Whether or not we agree with all 
these changes (and we’ve discussed these regula-
tions in detail in prior letters), we will simply have 
to adjust to them immediately. It’s important we 
describe to our shareholders how we will go about 
doing that and what it means for banks and, in 
particular, our bank.
First and foremost, banks must satisfy all of 
their regulators.
We must satisfy all of our regulators, and, remem-
ber, we have regulators all around the world, 
including more than 10 in the United States alone. 
Regulations include stress testing, reporting, com-
pliance, legal obligations and trading surveillance, 
among others. While the business is the first line of 
defense on all these issues, we also have 3,700 
people in compliance, 7,100 in risk and 1,400  
lawyers actively working every day to meet the  
letter and the spirit of these rules along with the 
final line of defense — audit. 
Rules are constantly changing and/or being 
enhanced and are sometimes, unfortunately, 
driven by political motivations. Relationships with 
regulators can often be intense, and, recently, we 
have lost some terrific people in our firm because 
of this. Regulators know that when banks disagree, 
we essentially have no choice — there is no one to 
appeal to, and even the act of appealing can make 
them angry. We simply ask respectfully to be 
heard, but at the end of the day, we will do what 
they ask us to do.
24
UPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY
Banks will play a smaller role in the global 
financial system. 
The chart above shows both the decreasing role 
and size of U.S. banks relative to the global econ-
omy alongside the increasing role and size of 
shadow banks. The data illustrates this dynamic. 
We expect this trend to continue for all the reasons 
I’ve discussed. 
Banks will continue to be guardians of the 
financial system.
Properly regulated banks are meant to protect and 
enhance the financial system. They are transpar-
ent with regulators, and they strive mightily to 
protect the system from terrorism financing and 
tax evasion as they implement know your cus-
tomer guidelines and anti-money laundering laws. 
They protect clients’ assets and clients’ money in 
movement. Banks also help customers — from 
protecting their data and minimizing fraud and 
cyber risk to providing financial education — and 
must abide by social requirements, such as the 
Community Reinvestment Act, which requires 
banks to extend their services into lower-income 
communities. As mentioned previously, unlike the 
private market, banks do not always choose when 
to provide a product or service but need to be 
there for their clients when they need credit or 
liquidity the most. 
Looking forward, we constantly modify our 
strategies to adjust to our market realities.
It’s always best to adjust to new reality quickly. We 
really don’t like crying over spilled milk, although 
we sometimes do. The new reality is that some 
things — for example, holding certain types of 
credit — are more efficiently done by a nonbank.

UPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY
Here are some actions we are taking to help our 
business succeed in the current and future 
environments:
1. First and foremost, we must conclude that hold-
ing certain types of credit, loans or otherwise 
has generally become less profitable because  
of the high levels of capital that need to be held 
against it — generally more than the market 
demands. What this means is that some credit  
is better held in a nonbank. Increasingly, for a 
credit relationship to make sense, banks need  
a lot of noncredit-related revenue. 
2. Because of various capital requirements, we try 
to reduce clients’ nonoperating cash deposits.
3. We are seeking to implement much tighter man-
agement and execution of business strategies. 
This includes repricing certain businesses, run-
ning off certain unprofitable products, changing 
the mix of business for a client, and more rigor-
ously evaluating client selection and resource 
optimization applied to clients.
4. We are exploring new capital optimization  
strategies, which could include partnerships 
and perhaps one day more securitizations, 
among other opportunities. 
5. Unfortunately, it is becoming increasingly diffi-
cult for banks to stay in the mortgage business, 
which ultimately hurts everyday Americans. The 
high costs of origination and servicing along with 
the complexity of regulations create a costly 
business with significant legal, reputational and 
operational challenges. In addition, given capital 
requirements and the lack of a healthy securiti-
zation market, it barely makes sense for banks  
to hold mortgages or mortgage-servicing rights. 
Many banks have already reduced much of this 
business. We are hanging on, continuing to hope 
for meaningful change.
6. We have the ability to add low-capital or 
no-capital revenue streams, like providing valu-
able data and analytics in trading, travel and 
other relevant offers in the consumer bank, 
wealth management and payment services 
businesses, among others. 
If you review our CEO letters, you will see that we 
have many growth opportunities in front of us and 
our plans to attack them. We face the future and 
the new competition, large and small, with confi-
dence, strength and a dash of humility.
KEEPING AN EYE ON ALL OF OUR 
COMPETITORS
The growing competition to banks from each other, 
as well as shadow banks, fintechs and large tech-
nology companies, is intense and clearly contribut-
ing to the diminishing role of banks and public 
companies in the United States and the global 
financial system. The pace of change and the size 
of the competition are extraordinary, and activity 
is accelerating. Walmart, for example (with over 
200 million in-store customers each week), can 
use new digital technologies to efficiently bring 
banking-type services to their customers. Apple, 
already a strong presence in banking-type services 
with Apple Pay and the Apple Card, is actively 
moving into other similar services such as payment 
processing, credit risk assessment, person-to- 
person payment systems, merchant acquiring and 
buy-now-pay-later offers. Large tech companies, 
already 100% digital, have hundreds of millions of 
customers, as well as enormous resources, in data 
and proprietary systems — all of which give them 
an extraordinary competitive advantage. 
We remain confident that as long as we stay  
vigilant, hungry, adaptable, fast and disciplined, 
we will continue to succeed in building this great 
company.

UPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY
As recent countries and companies have demon-
strated, great management and leadership are 
critical to any large organization’s long-term  
success. While providing strong management is a 
disciplined and rigorous process — facts, analysis, 
detail, rinse and repeat — creating an exceptional 
management team is an art, not a science.
In the rest of this section, I talk about some  
management lessons — I always enjoy sharing 
what I have learned over time by watching others 
and through my own successes and failures. 
BUILDING TRUE FRANCHISE VALUE
Accounting can distort actual economic 
reality.
I have spoken in the past about good and bad reve-
nue and good and bad expenses. Certain expenses, 
such as opening well-designed and well-located 
branches, actually are long-term investments of 
great value. Conversely, poorly underwritten credit 
creates revenue that you are bound to regret.  
Further, there are accounting practices that may 
distort the true value of actions you take. For 
example, when we create a new credit card 
account, we recognize origination costs over  
12 months, but an average account exists for over 
eight years. And with the new accounting rules for 
loan loss reserves — called the current expected 
credit losses standard — you book the expected life 
of loan losses on the day you make the loan, while 
the revenue comes in over multiple years.
Increasingly in the modern world, many valuable 
things are not reflected on our balance sheet in 
generally accepted accounting principles — for 
example, previously expensed intellectual prop-
erty or extraordinary human capital. At the end of 
the day, human capital is the most valuable asset. 
Think of a great athlete, a great lawyer or a great 
artist. It’s not simply the equipment — it’s the 
extraordinary training and talent of those 
involved, as we’ve also seen with the U.S. military. 
And sometimes it’s not the individual but the 
highly coordinated activities of the team that 
deliver the championship.
Finally, if any value is based upon models, one 
must really test the sensitivity of the outcome 
against changes in assumptions. Understanding 
the range of potential outcomes may be far more 
important than the point estimate created by a 
model. In some cases, you can have an excellent 
average outcome but with a chance of death.
The point is: Accounting can distort economic real-
ity and can lead one to make the wrong decisions. 
Building true franchise value requires an 
outcomes-based outlook.
In banking, specific examples illustrate how merely 
following accounting and capital rules — without 
thinking through the outcomes— can lead one 
astray. I’m going to describe just two examples, 
but there are hundreds more. 
If you buy or create a loan at par and put it on your 
balance sheet at par (think of a mortgage) and 
internally finance it, even match-funded with 10% 
capital, you might believe you have a 12% return. 
Many companies subscribe to this interpretation 
and simply continue to borrow money to invest in 
such a thing. But I would tell you this product has 
Management Lessons

no franchise value because it is only worth par, 
and, in fact, a small change in that value (because 
of interest rates and credit spread) could mean 
that you have made a huge mistake. If, on the 
other hand, you create a loan and sell it at more 
than par at a profit, you have created value — 
whether or not you keep it on your balance sheet. 
And far more important, if you create a loan and at 
the same time forge a client relationship — and you 
add additional capital-light revenue, such as asset 
management and cash management — you have 
created something of long-term value that you can 
nurture and grow. This is franchise value.
Simply taking interest rate risk (which contributed 
to the downfall of SVB) is not a business. Nor is 
simply taking credit risk. One person and a com-
puter will suffice — you do not need 290,000  
people circling the globe to do that. 
Another example relates to any branch-based 
business. Let’s say I build a system with well- 
designed and well-located branches, staffed by 
well-trained personnel who can offer customers 
great products and services and who strive to do 
every task a little bit better. Then you build a 
branch system with outdated sites in poor loca-
tions (often to save money) that have undertrained 
and underpaid staff and lower-quality products 
and services. Between the two, my branch system 
will win every time. One system will have high 
franchise value and be self-perpetuating with high 
returns. The other enterprise is probably on the 
road to eventual failure. If you study the history  
of business, you can see this phenomenon play  
out in grocery stores, car companies, restaurants, 
retailers and various other enterprises. 
LEARNING FROM INVESTOR DAY 
In February 2021, we did not hold our annual Inves-
tor Day for the obvious reason — COVID-19. When 
February 2022 came around, we were somewhat 
happy to be relieved of that responsibility again. 
Investor Day is a tremendous amount of work. But 
from 2020 to 2022, we did a lot of investment 
spending and made several acquisitions. Some of 
our analysts questioned whether we were being 
transparent enough in terms of what we were doing 
and why we were doing it. While sometimes we get 
frustrated with investor demands — and not all 
investors are created equally — all investors should 
be treated fairly and with respect. So, in 2022, we 
gave it more thought and reversed course with an 
extensive Investor Day. Our senior management 
team explained in detail our acquisitions and our 
investments, answering every question to the best 
of their ability. Having to explain your business to 
investors, comparing yourself with competitors and 
looking at the business as a whole — across sales, 
marketing, returns, growth, risks and strategic 
opportunities — was a terrific exercise for us.  
We learned our lesson!
This also raises another issue. Of course, it is criti-
cally important to analyze your business at the 
right disaggregated level — right down to the 
branch — inside the company. But it is also import-
ant to have the proper segments reported exter-
nally to the company, properly accounted for and 
generally aligned to their relevant competitors. 
This actually helps hold managers accountable by 
forcing them to accurately assess performance — 
the good, the bad and the ugly — without any 
attempts to avoid reality through an external 
obfuscation of results.

MANAGEMENT LESSONS
BALANCING A CUSTOMER-CENTRIC 
APPROACH WITH (EXCESSIVE) RISK
Most businesses, including banks like us, say they 
put their customers first. We often go further than 
that statement to say that we need to be there for 
them, in good times and in bad. However, banking 
is a complex industry, and this customer-centric 
approach requires a little more explanation. 
In our business, we are essentially a financial 
partner to a client. While we strive to build great 
client relationships based on trust over the long 
run, our role has intricacies. For example, we do 
not need every transaction to make economic 
sense — just the overall client relationship, year 
after year. Whatever the transaction, we need to 
be properly compensated for the risks we bear, 
which can be extraordinary. Very often, a client 
will merely look for the lowest price, which we 
completely understand; we recognize that some-
times banks are perfectly willing to make a cer-
tain transaction for a client at a loss. There are 
also occasions when we need to tell a client that a 
specific financial transaction would be imprudent 
— maybe for us and the client. 
Say, for example, that a very strong client of ours 
is simply trying to get the best price for a lever-
aged loan. If we believe the desired price is unwise 
and another institution is willing to offer it, we will 
advise the client to take that option. For us, this is 
pure counterparty risk and not really part of our 
core relationship. Conversely, should the same  
client come to us and request something that 
extends beyond what we consider reasonable  
for that transaction, we may nonetheless do it. 
Perhaps the client is in the middle of an M&A 
transaction in difficult markets and simply cannot 
get the financing they need — other than from us. 
In recent crises, we have often gone the extra  
mile for a client at great risks to ourselves, not  
to make a profit but to rescue the client from 
financial calamity.
Fundamentally, putting the client first means 
always providing them with the products and ser-
vices they need (although they may go somewhere 
else because of price) and having our whole team 
work hard for them — either in the United States or 
around the world, reliably and with constancy. One 
of the most important things we do for a client, 
above all else, is to be a steady hand, providing 
financial safety and security at every turn.

Some Commonsense Principles 
for Corporate Governance
I have written before about the diminishing role of 
public companies in the American financial system. 
They peaked in 1996 at 7,300 and now total 4,600. 
Conversely, the number of private U.S. companies 
backed by private equity firms has grown from 
1,900 to 11,200 over the last two decades. And this 
does not include the increasing number of compa-
nies owned by sovereign wealth funds and family 
offices. This migration is serious and worthy of 
critical study, and it may very well increase with 
more regulation and litigation coming. We really 
need to consider: Is this the outcome we want? 
There are good reasons for such healthy private 
markets, and some good outcomes have resulted 
from them as well. The reasons are complex  
and may include public market factors such as 
onerous reporting requirements, higher litigation 
expenses, costly regulations, cookie-cutter board 
governance, less compensation flexibility, height-
ened public scrutiny and the relentless pressure  
of quarterly earnings. 
With intensified public reporting, investors’ grow-
ing needs for environmental, social and gover-
nance information and the universal proxy — which 
makes it very easy to put disruptive directors on a 
board — the pressure to become a private com-
pany will rise. Corporate governance principles are 
becoming more and more templated and formu-
laic, which is a negative trend. For example, some-
times proxy advisors automatically judge board 
members unfavorably if they have been on the 
board a long time, without a fair assessment of 
their actual contributions or experience. And some 
simple, sensible governance principles are far bet-
ter than the formulaic ones. The governance of 
major corporations is evolving into a bureaucratic 
compliance exercise instead of focusing on its rela-
tionship to long-term economic value. Good corpo-
rate governance is critical, and a little common 
sense would go a long way.
PROMOTING OPEN COMMUNICATION AND 
TRUST WITH THE BOARD 
As authorized and coordinated by the board, direc-
tors should have unfettered access to manage-
ment, including those below the CEO’s direct 
reports. At every board meeting, to ensure open 
and free discussion, the full board should meet in 
executive session without the CEO or other mem-
bers of management. The independent directors 
should ensure that they have enough time to do 
this properly.
This one act would allow the board to have a com-
pletely open conversation and provide candid 
feedback to the CEO and management team. Good 
CEOs, who are trying to do the best job they can, 
should appreciate this important feedback — and 
should know how difficult it is to gather in a large 
group. This type of quality discussion among and 
with board members leads to collaboration and 
good succession planning since every meeting 
should include a real conversation around this 
important topic. Meetings such as these allow  
the board to nurture the extraordinary value of 
collaboration and trust. 
CONFRONTING SUCCESSION PLANNING
Our board is responsible for succession planning, 
and it is on the agenda every time board members 
meet — both when they are with me and when I am 
not in the room. We already have a “hit-by-the-
truck” plan ready to go (not all companies can say 
this), and we have multiple successor candidates 
who are well-known to the board and to the inves-
tor community. The board believes this is one of its 
paramount priorities. You can rest assured that 
our board members are on the case and are very 
comfortable with where we are. 
30
SOME COMMONSENSE PRINCIPLES FOR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
ACTIVE ENGAGEMENT WITH ASSET 
MANAGERS 
We — companies and investors — need to become 
more active and involved in proxy issues each 
year to foster better communication between the 
investors and the board of the companies they 
own. Whether it’s issues around climate risk or 
say on pay, it should be appropriate for the man-
agement team or board to actively engage with 
investors during proxy season to hear and under-
stand each other’s views on key issues and com-
municate their positions in real time. Investors 
should also require proxy advisors to share any 
communications they have with a company in real 
time before investors make voting decisions. In 
my view, too many portfolio managers and inves-
tors have partially ceded critical decisions on key 
proxy issues to their internal stewardship groups 
or external proxy advisors. Stewardship teams 
are also often under pressure to follow proxy 
advisors by bureaucratic internal systems at 
investment firms that discourage disagreement 
and encourage the safety of the herd. Many port-
folio managers have told me that even when they 
have the authority to override the internal group, 
it is frequently very difficult to do so. 
The new universal proxy is likely to create 
havoc for companies.
The new universal proxy makes it such that one 
investor with one share, who owns it for as little 
as one day, can nominate a director for any rea-
son, at relatively low cost. In my view, it is likely 
that not just activists but also special interest 
groups will nominate directors. Not only would 
this be extremely disruptive to the board, but, 
almost by their nature, special interest groups 
would be counter to shareholders’ interests. While 
we fully respect being transparent — protecting 
investors and shareholder rights — director elec-
tion processes are becoming too far removed 
from shareholder interests. 
While there are legitimate complaints against 
entrenched boards, good boards often tend to 
interview prospective candidates for their brains, 
integrity, work ethic, management and collabora-
tion skills, and experience. With this new universal 
proxy, it’s easy to envision a time when a proxy 
season will be like a political campaign, with inter-
est groups on both sides of an issue trying to elect 
a board member. Disruptive boards, which can be 
caused by just a single troublesome member, are 
an anathema to shareholders’ interests. This is 
unlikely to end well. 
 
31
SOME COMMONSENSE PRINCIPLES FOR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
We usually don’t worry about typical economic 
fluctuations and often compare economic forecast-
ing with weather forecasting: It is extremely com-
plicated, easy to do in the short term and far more 
difficult to do in the long run. It is particularly hard 
to forecast true longer-term inflection points in the 
economy. Although we don’t want to waste time on 
“normal” fluctuations, we do want to be prepared 
for economic extremes — we look at multiple pos-
sibilities and probabilities and manage our com-
pany so that we can handle all of them, whether or 
not we think they actually will happen. After we 
spoke last year about storm clouds, some of those 
storms did indeed hit, and, unfortunately, some of 
those threatening clouds are still here. 
2022 was not normal, economically speaking, and, 
in fact, 2022 witnessed several dramatic events — 
the Ukraine war began; inflation hit a 40-year high 
of 9%; the federal funds rate experienced one of 
its most rapid increases, up 425 basis points, 
albeit from a low level; stock markets were down 
20%; unemployment fell to a 50-year low at 3.5%; 
and the U.S. economy was bolstered by frequent 
fiscal stimulus and by high and rising government 
debt while supply chain issues eased. In addition, 
work from home began to raise commercial real 
estate challenges, and, finally, long- and short-
term interest rates presented a sharply inverted 
yield curve, which is “eight for eight” in terms of 
predicting a recession (more on this later). But,  
surprisingly, the global economy marched ahead. 
THE CURRENT ECONOMY: PRETTY GOOD 
BUT STORM CLOUDS AHEAD
Until the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, the cur-
rent economy was performing adequately, both 
here in the United States and remarkably better 
than anyone expected in Europe. The “market” 
was generally forecasting either a soft landing or a 
mild recession, with interest rates peaking at 5% 
and then slowly coming down.
There has been a lot of market volatility over the 
past year, partially, in my opinion, as people 
over-extrapolate monthly data, which is highly dis-
torted by inflation, supply chain adjustments, con-
sumer substitution, basically poor assumptions 
about housing costs and other factors. But under-
lying all this, consumers have been spending 7% to 
9% more than in the prior year and 23% more 
than pre-COVID-19. Similarly, their balance sheets 
are in great shape as they still have, according to 
our own analysis, $1.2 trillion more “excess cash” 
in their checking accounts than before the pan-
demic (credit card debt is simply normalizing).  
In addition, unemployment is extremely low, and 
wages are going up, particularly at the low end. 
We’ve had 10 years of home and stock price appre-
ciation, and even if we go into a recession, con-
sumers would enter it in far better shape than 
during the great financial crisis. Finally, supply 
chains are recovering, businesses are pretty 
healthy and credit losses are extremely low. 
The failures of SVB and Credit Suisse have signifi-
cantly changed the market’s expectations, bond 
prices have recovered dramatically, the stock mar-
ket is down and the market’s odds of a recession 
have increased. And while this is nothing like 2008, 
it is not clear when this current crisis will end. It 
has provoked lots of jitters in the market and will 
clearly cause some tightening of financial condi-
tions as banks and other lenders become more 
conservative. However, it is unclear whether this 
disruption is likely to slow consumer spending (as 
of April 1, 2023, spending has been consistently 
running higher versus the prior year). Although 
higher rates, particularly in mortgages, have 
reduced both home sales and prices, do remember 
that consumer spending drives more than 65% of 
the U.S. economy. 
Evaluating and Managing  
the Economic and Geopolitical 
Risks Ahead  
32
EVALUATING AND MANAGING THE ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL RISKS AHEAD
While the current crisis has exposed some weak-
nesses in the system, it should not be considered, 
as I pointed out, anything like what we experienced 
in 2008. Nonetheless, we do have other unique 
and complicated issues in front of us, which are 
outlined in the chart above. 
POTENTIAL TROUBLE BREWING FROM 
UNPRECEDENTED FISCAL SPENDING, 
QUANTITATIVE TIGHTENING AND 
GEOPOLITICAL TENSIONS
Having already confessed to how difficult it is to 
predict the future, for planning purposes it still 
makes sense to try to assess the environment 
ahead by laying out those factors that may be  
significantly different from the past. 
Fiscal stimulus is still surging through the 
system.
In the last three years, partially but not entirely 
due to the pandemic, the federal government had 
a deficit of $3.1 trillion (2020), $2.8 trillion (2021) 
and $1.4 trillion (2022). These are extraordinary 
numbers, which ended up in consumers’ pockets, 
in states and local municipalities, and even in com-
panies. We pointed out last year that you simply 
cannot have this level of spending and say that it’s 
not inflationary. It’s also important to point out 
that there is a multiplier effect of this stimulus; 
that is, one person’s spending is another person’s 
income and so on. The deficit for the next three 
years is now estimated to be $1.4 trillion to $1.8 
trillion per year, which is also an extraordinary 
number, with no end in sight. In Europe, fiscal defi-
cits are high — even before the enormous subsidies 
given to consumers to counterbalance higher 
energy prices. It’s also important to note that  
borrowing to invest is fundamentally different 
from borrowing to consume — borrowing to con-
sume can only be inflationary.
This is before any additional costs related to future 
recessions, the war or any other unforeseeable 
events. Offsetting this, by sometime late this year 
or early next year, we expect consumers will have 
spent the bulk of their remaining excess savings. It 
remains to be seen whether this will cause a little 
bit of a cliff effect or whether consumer spending 
will simply slow down. Either way, this will add to 
whatever recessionary pressures there are some-
time in the future. 
Today’s quantitative tightening is following 
more than a decade of quantitative easing.
In the two years after COVID-19, the Fed bought 
$4.5 trillion of U.S. Treasuries and mortgage- 
backed securities, bringing its total balance sheet 
to $9 trillion. We have experienced almost 12 
years of quantitative easing (QE), which drove 
interest rates down — so much so that U.S. short-
term rates were virtually zero, and the 10-year 
bond hit a low of 0.5%. Amazingly, tens of trillions 
of dollars of debt, mostly in Europe, sold at negative 
interest rates (we will look back upon this with 
total astonishment). This period of QE also led  
to extraordinary liquidity (and a surging money

EVALUATING AND MANAGING THE ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL RISKS AHEAD
supply) that undoubtedly drove increased prices 
across many investment classes — from stocks  
and bonds to crypto, meme stocks and real estate, 
among others. Importantly, this also increased 
bank deposits from $13 trillion to $18 trillion  
(and the now-famous uninsured deposits from  
$6 trillion to $8 trillion). 
QE is now being reversed into quantitative tighten-
ing (QT) as the Fed grapples with inflation. So far, 
the Fed has reduced its securities holdings by 
approximately $550 billion and is committed to 
reducing its holdings by almost $100 billion in 
securities each month or over $1 trillion each year. 
How all this will unfold is still unknown as the 
direction and speed of money have changed sig-
nificantly from prior years. To varying degrees, 
banks will compete for money, not only among one 
another but also with money market funds, other 
investments and the Fed itself. Money market fund 
total assets under management have increased  
by $650 billion since April 2022, with a significant 
portion migrating into the Fed’s reverse repo facil-
ity, thereby draining deposits from the banking 
system. So while the Fed’s balance sheet has come 
down by approximately $550 billion, deposits at 
the banks have come down by $1 trillion, largely 
uninsured deposits. Unfortunately, some banks 
invested much of these excess deposits in “safe” 
Treasuries, which, of course, went down in value as 
rates rose faster than most people expected. 
It should be noted that an inordinate amount of 
attention is focused on short-term interest rates, 
which the Fed affects directly. But the Fed does 
not completely control long-term rates and liquid-
ity, which are influenced by both supply and 
demand (QT) and global investor preferences and 
sentiment — importantly, including views on risk 
and safety. It is also important to remember that 
while the central banks of the world are now sell-
ing instead of buying securities, the governments 
of the world have larger debts to finance. The 
United States alone needs to sell $2 trillion in  
securities, which must be absorbed in the market. 
This turn of events is generally true globally.
There has been huge intervention by central banks 
around the world over the last decade. While it was 
completely necessary in 2008 and 2009 to stop 
the worst of the global financial crisis, and again in 
2020 to stop the effects of the global pandemic, 
the depth and breadth of these interventions will 
be studied for years as will the extent to which we 
need QT (whose full effect may not be known 
immediately). It is unclear how the Fed incorpo-
rated the enormous fiscal spending into both its 
forecasts for growth and inflation, as well as its 
need to continue QE as it did. And importantly, the 
Fed’s ability to reverse course on this strategy (QT) 
is somewhat constrained by higher inflation 
(though, of course, it can temporarily adjust its 
actions to deal with the current bank failure crisis).  
War complicates geopolitics and materially 
adds risks.
We have not had a major land war in Europe since 
1945. The war in Ukraine, already into its second 
year, has been particularly devastating in terms of 
casualties and damage and has been haunted by 
the threat of nuclear weapons. It may very well 
last for many more years. Wars are unpredictable, 
and at the start, most predictions about how they 
will end have been completely wrong. 
This war is also affecting global energy and food 
supplies, with a disproportionate and negative 
effect falling on poor people and poorer nations, 
including millions of Ukrainian refugees. There is 
still a risk that energy and food supply lines, which 
are not secure, will lead to higher prices and the 
large migration of people, triggering another level 
of geopolitical dislocation. 
The tensions of this war are also leading to the 
rethinking of many economic alliances, as well  
as trade and national security. All these factors 
create more risk and potentially higher inflation, 
and their confluence (along with inflation and QT) 
creates a somewhat unpredictable and dangerous 
outcome. 
This may be a once-in-a-generation sea 
change, with material effect.
Of course, there is always uncertainty. I am often 
frustrated when people talk about today’s uncer-
tainty as if it were any different from yesterday’s 
uncertainty. However, in this case, I believe it  
actually is.

EVALUATING AND MANAGING THE ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL RISKS AHEAD
Less predictable geopolitics, in general, and a 
complex adjustment to relationships with China 
are probably leading to higher military spending 
and a realignment of global economic and military 
alliances.
Higher fiscal spending, higher debt to gross 
domestic product (GDP), higher investment spend 
in general (including climate spending), higher 
energy costs and the inflationary effect of trade 
adjustments all lead me to believe that we may 
have gone from a savings glut to scarce capital  
and may be headed to higher inflation and higher 
interest rates than in the immediate past. 
Essentially, we may be moving, as I read some-
where, from a virtuous cycle to a vicious cycle. 
PREPARING FOR WHAT MAY BE A NEW  
AND UNCERTAIN FUTURE
Of course, we hope that everything turns out okay 
and that all of these storm clouds peacefully and 
painlessly dissipate – and we need to be prepared 
for that outcome. We also need to be prepared for 
a new and uncertain future. The new risks (in 
addition to the normal ones, like recession) are 
higher inflation for longer, the market effects of  
QT and growing political risks. Of course, I cannot 
be sure this will happen, but I place higher odds  
on it than the “market.”
Managing risks is far more than simply 
meeting the Fed’s annual stress test. 
While it is critical that we meet and pass the Fed’s 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) 
stress test, managing risk is far more than that – 
and we are fairly fanatical when it comes to manag-
ing risk. Our company does hundreds of stress tests 
a week, which include market movements reflective 
of many past crises (such as volatility resulting 
from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the pandemic 
in 2020) and rapidly rising interest rates. 
The Fed’s CCAR stress test, by its nature, has fairly 
arbitrary results since it uses only one different 
and hypothetical scenario each year. This creates 
uncertainty around our capital requirements (as I 
mentioned, this may damage the value of bank 
stocks and the banking system). If I were a share-
holder, I would want to know if my company would 
really lose the $44 billion after taxes (over a 
nine-quarter period) that the stress test shows. 
And the answer is absolutely not.
While I understand why regulators stress test this 
way — they are essentially trying to ensure that 
banks survive the worst-case scenario (which 
assumes multiple problems at a struggling bank 
without any benefit from good management or 
rapid response) — the methodology clearly does 
not result in an accurate forecast of how our com-
pany would perform under adverse circumstances. 
I have very little doubt that if the severely adverse 
scenario played out, JPMorgan Chase would per-
form far better than the stress test projections.  
I believe we would actually make money over the 
nine quarters in the Fed’s stress scenario.
Here’s one example that illustrates this. From 
March 5 to March 20, 2020, when the stock market 
fell 24% and the bond index spread gapped from 
191 to 446 basis points prior to major Fed inter-
vention, our actual trading revenue was higher 
than normal as we actively made markets for our 
clients. By contrast, the hypothetical stress test 
had us losing a huge amount of money in market 
making, based on the way it is calculated. One 
more thing to point out: JPMorgan Chase now has 
enough total loss-absorbing capacity to bear out 
peak CCAR losses (using the Fed’s numbers) more 
than eight times over. 
In addition to CCAR testing, we stress test for vari-
ous types of huge market disruptions. For exam-
ple, we stress counterparties — such as hedge 
funds, large asset managers or trading houses — 
for extremely large market moves, perhaps an 
instantaneous 130 basis point move in Treasuries 
or 50% to 60% moves in commodities. Our share-
holders should know that regarding any major 
international bank, we remain well-collateralized 
across all of our exposures. Even if one of those 
banks went bankrupt overnight, we would be okay. 
While there is always a risk that we won’t receive a 
margin call or that some trades may default and 
leave us exposed to large market risk, the losses 
likely would not be material.
Suffice it to say, our company prepares not only for 
various forms of extreme economic risk but for 
various forms of geopolitical risk. Later in this letter 
I describe how we have enhanced those efforts. 
35
EVALUATING AND MANAGING THE ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL RISKS AHEAD
Don’t underestimate the extreme importance 
of interest rates.
Interest rates are extraordinarily important — they 
are the cosmological constant, or the mathemati-
cal certainty, that affects all things economic. 
Before I comment on that, I want to share some 
astounding numbers to illustrate this point:
When you analyze a stock, you look at many factors: 
earnings, cash flow, competition, margins, scenar-
ios, consumer preferences, new technologies and 
so on. But the math above is immovable and 
affects all. 
In a rapidly rising rate environment, any invest-
ment where the cash flows were expected in the 
out years would have been dramatically affected — 
think venture capital or real estate development, 
for example. Any form of carry trade (effectively 
borrowing short and investing long) would be 
sorely disappointed. Carry trade exists not just in 
banks but is embedded and is silently present in 
companies, investment vehicles and others, includ-
ing situations that require recurring refinancing. 
We are prepared for potentially higher interest 
rates, and we may have higher inflation for 
longer. 
If we have higher inflation for longer, the Fed may 
be forced to increase rates higher than people 
expect despite the recent bank crisis. Also, QT may 
have ongoing impacts that might, over time, be 
another force, pushing longer-term rates higher 
than currently envisioned. This may occur even if 
we have a mild — or not-so-mild — recession, as we 
saw in the 1970s and 1980s. 
Today’s inverted yield curve implies that we are 
going into a recession. As someone once said, an 
inverted yield curve like this is “eight for eight”  
in predicting a recession in the next 12 months. 
However, it may not be true this time because of 
the enormous effect of QT. As previously stated, 
longer-term rates are not necessarily controlled 
by central banks, and it is possible that the inver-
sion we see today is still driven by prior QE and 
not the dramatic change in supply and demand 
that is going to take place in the future. 
We have always looked at the “fat tails” of higher 
interest rates, particularly on our own company. 
We were premature in thinking about the possibil-
ity of interest rates going to 5%, 6% or 7% — which 
still might not happen, but we always want to be 
protected against this outcome. For example, we 
have spoken about stockpiling cash, not investing 
in sovereign debt when rates were low and being 
willing to forgo income to protect against rising 
rates. Rest assured, our company can handle  
significantly higher interest rates no matter how 
anyone analyzes capital. 
Higher interest rates will obviously have an 
important impact, not just for banks but for some 
of those who borrow on a floating rate or those 
who have to refinance in a higher rate environ-
ment. If this tide goes out, you should assume that 
it will expose additional weaknesses in the econ-
omy. However, our company is prepared — not only 
for higher rates but for a potential recession that 
could arise and related credit losses. That prepara-
tion includes analyzing all of our clients (in particu-
lar our leveraged lending, real estate and other cli-
ents) for what the impact of higher rates may 
mean for them. We believe the risks within our 
own portfolio are manageable. And we try to ana-
lyze the impact of these factors on companies and 
industries away from us. For example, we do 
expect that some types of real estate in certain 
locations may come under pressure. 
Finally, we assume all of these risks and uncertain-
ties will result in volatile markets.

EVALUATING AND MANAGING THE ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL RISKS AHEAD
There are risks and opportunities in the 
restructuring of global economic relations.
There is no question that supply chains need to be 
restructured for three different reasons:
• For any products or materials that are essential 
for national security (think rare earths, 5G and 
semiconductors), the U.S. supply chain must be 
domestic or only open to completely friendly 
allies or partners. We cannot and should not 
ever be reliant on processes that can and will be 
used against us, especially when we are most 
vulnerable. All countries will be protecting their 
national security in their own way, tailoring their 
strategies as they see fit. 
• Countries will also be taking specific action to 
protect critical industries (think electric vehicles 
(EV), AI and chips) that may not be directly 
related to national security but are key to 
national competitiveness. This is essentially 
what America’s IRA is meant to do. 
• Companies will diversify their supply chains  
simply to be more resilient. 
This restructuring will likely take place over time 
and does not need to be excessively disruptive. 
There will be winners and losers — some of the 
main beneficiaries will be Brazil, Canada, Mexico 
and friendly Southeast Asian nations.
For similar national security reasons, activities — 
including investment activities — that help create a 
national security risk (e.g., sharing critical technol-
ogy with potential adversaries) should be restricted.
While focusing on the risks, it’s also important  
not to forget the opportunities. The transition to  
a green economy will eventually require $4 trillion  
a year in capital expenditures. The IRA, CHIPS Act 
and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law combined will 
create huge opportunities for companies, investors 
and entrepreneurs across virtually every industry 
group in the United States. You can rest assured 
that our company is organizing to help clients 
make the most of these opportunities. 
Along with reconfiguring our supply chains, we 
must create new trading systems with our allies. 
My preference would be to rejoin the Trans-Pacific 
Partnership — it is the best geostrategic trade 
arrangement possible with allied nations. You can 
be certain that our company is closely monitoring 
and adjusting to the risks and opportunities cre-
ated by current events. 
Believe it or not, inflation and interest rates are 
not the things that worry me the most. I’m most 
concerned about large geopolitical events, cyber 
attacks, nuclear proliferation, large dysfunctional 
markets (partially due to poorly calibrated regula-
tions; e.g., the U.K. Gilt and U.S. Treasury markets) 
and failure of other critical infrastructure.
We have established a new Security Forum.
The war in Ukraine has exposed the severity, com-
plexity and interconnectivity of threats such as 
physical security, the loss of nonbank critical infra-
structure (i.e., communication networks), pandem-
ics, insider threats, trade relations, political risk, 
sanctions, data privacy, war, and the impact of 
regulatory and governmental actions. All these 
factors affect our company, as well as our clients 
and countries and their governments. You should 
know that we have formed a new Security Forum, 
which meets periodically and enables manage-
ment to continually assess the impact of ongoing 
threats to our company, our clients and countries 
around the globe. These risks — which include mar-
ket risk, credit risk, cyber risk and operational risk, 
among others — are also covered at the board level 
by our Risk Committee.
Finally, when one talks about risk for too long, it 
begins to cloud your judgment. Looking ahead, the 
positives are huge.  However events play out, it is 
likely that 20 years from now, America’s GDP will be 
more than twice the size it is today, and hundreds of 
millions of people around the world will have been 
lifted out of poverty. In the next section, I talk more 
about the need for a global economic strategy. 
37
EVALUATING AND MANAGING THE ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL RISKS AHEAD
Like most Americans, I get frustrated with the 
mediocrity and bureaucracy of the massive admin-
istrative state. We accept it too readily. And it dam-
ages the confidence we have in our own country.  
I have enormous respect for the people who work 
for the U.S. government, but we simply don’t invest 
enough in making it more effective. Some examples 
are: antiquated systems at the Federal Aviation 
Administration, United States Postal Service and 
Internal Revenue Service; inefficient ports and 
crumbling infrastructure; an ineffective immigra-
tion policy; policies that prevent affordable housing 
and leave apartments vacant; policies that hurt 
Puerto Rico; tenure versus merit-based compensa-
tion and promotion; and work rules that dramati-
cally reduce efficiency. We have a vast system with 
a lack of accountability and proper reporting. And 
usually when reports are issued, they only address 
how much money was spent — not, for example, 
how many highway miles were built, in what time 
period and at what cost. Government, which is 20% 
of the economy, seems to be getting less produc-
tive over time, unlike the rest of the economy. In 
addition, we have too much litigation — this is the 
bureaucratization of America — think Europe. 
To be completely fair, I am also frustrated with the 
typically shortsighted selfishness of some busi-
nesses, asking for abundant special tax breaks and 
often using regulations to protect the incumbent. I 
also want to express exasperation with some of my 
fellow citizens who don’t pay the taxes they owe on 
the order of $600 billion a year, who won’t con-
sider sensible policy measures like a carbon tax to 
stem climate change and who sometimes seem to 
only like democracy when the voters agree with 
them. Democracy by its nature is compromise. One 
of the lessons of the past decade is that if major 
legislation cannot be done in a bipartisan way, 
maybe it should not be done at all. 
DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE POLICY AND 
EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT
Theology is not policy. Policy based on falsehood 
or oversimplified facts is doomed to failure. Too 
often now, policy starts as politics without the 
benefit of analytics and experts. 
Policy should precede politics — not the other 
way around.
Policy should be painstakingly developed based on 
facts and analysis (and on information about how 
policies were productively developed in other 
parts of the world). You can effectively crowd-
source policy expertise. Why were Germany and 
Switzerland so successful with apprenticeship pro-
grams? Why were Canada and Singapore so effec-
tive with permitting and infrastructure? All poli-
cies, like education, infrastructure and regulation, 
need to start with an agreed-upon goal — and be 
comprehensive and coordinated to accomplish it. 
After the core of a policy is developed, then, of 
course, it will be modified by political leaders — but 
it is hoped the core of the policy remains intact. If 
those modifications bastardize it in such a way as to 
render it inefficient, it should be dropped. 
We require a 21st century government.
In a company, you are constantly setting up your 
organization for success. We need to find a way to 
more rapidly reorganize our government for the 
new world. While Congress can often move very 
quickly in a crisis, we are unable to move quickly 
as a government over the medium term. We need 
to move faster, adopt new technologies and retrain 
human capital more quickly. Even in a good  
company, reorganizing for change can be hard — 
business and staff units fight to maintain their  
status quo and perceived prerogatives as if their 
lives were at stake. I can only imagine how hard 
this is in the government, but it will only get worse 
if we do not fix this in our fast-changing world.
Our Serious Need for More  
Effective Public Policy  
and Competent Government

OUR SERIOUS NEED FOR MORE EFFECTIVE PUBLIC POLICY AND COMPETENT GOVERNMENT
By Jamie Dimon
R
ussia’s invasion of Ukraine punc-
tured many assumptions about the 
future of the world and thus was a 
pivotal moment in history. America and the 
West can no longer maintain a false sense 
of security based on the illusion that dicta-
torships and oppressive nations won’t use 
their economic and military powers to  
advance their aims—particularly against 
what they perceive as weak, incompetent 
and disorganized Western democracies. In 
a troubled world, we are reminded that  
national security is and always will be  
paramount, even if it seems to recede in 
tranquil times.
It should also lay to rest the idea that 
America can stand alone. U.S. leaders must 
always put America first, but global peace 
and order is a vital American interest. Only 
America has the full capability to lead and 
coalesce the Western world, though we 
must do so respectfully and in partnership 
with our allies. Without cohesiveness and 
unity with our allies, autocratic forces will 
divide and conquer the bickering West. 
America needs to lead with its strengths—
not only military but also economic, diplo-
matic and moral. Here’s what we can do:
• Rededicate ourselves to the qualities 
and principles that made America great. 
These principles are life, liberty, the pursuit 
of happiness and the idea that all people  
are created equal. Democracy and human 
freedom are inseparable from freedom of 
speech, freedom of religion and free enter-
prise. It would help to educate all Americans 
about the sacrifice of those who came before 
us for democracy at home and abroad.
We need to acknowledge the critical role 
that government plays—and we need  
government to be more competent and  
accountable. We must build stronger safety 
nets to care for the poor, the old and the 
disabled, and to cushion adjustment to  
economic change, while also maintaining 
economic dynamism, individual responsi-
bility and the dignity of work. We must 
confront crises and failures of public policy 
by developing better policies and by  
dealing with realities. We can recognize 
the mistakes America has made without 
disparaging the nation. 
We support global human rights and 
stand on the side of liberty, but we also 
have to be realistic about the compromises 
necessary to accomplish long-term goals. 
Remember Franklin D. Roosevelt and 
Winston Churchill allied with Stalin against 
Hitler’s imminent threat.
• Develop a Marshall Plan for global 
energy and food security. This will be 
critical both in keeping the Western  
alliances together and minimizing the 
global suffering caused by starvation. 
Global energy and food supply chains are 
precarious by their nature. And it should  
be self-evident that energy security and 
preventing climate change aren’t contra-
dictory: Secure and reliable oil and gas 
production is compatible with reducing 
CO2 over the long run, and is far better 
than burning more coal. It should also  
be self-evident that global food and energy 
security relies on realistic trade policy and 
American military strength.
• Increase military spending, along 
with our allies, as much as necessary to 
protect the world. Not only is America a 
bastion of freedom; it is still the arsenal of 
democracy, and economic sanctions are no 
substitute for an effective military. “We 
know only too well that war comes not 
when the forces of freedom are strong, but 
when they are weak,” as Ronald Reagan 
said in 1980. Military strength needs to  
be combined and coordinated with strong 
diplomatic and economic aid for the devel-
oping world. Thoughtful policies would 
help many nations lift up their people,  
develop their human rights and join eco-
nomic unions that are good for all involved.
• Recover our economic dynamism. A 
strong economy is the foundation for 
American power, and we haven’t focused 
enough on economic growth. Between 
2000 and 2020, real U.S. GDP grew at an 
average rate of only 1.7% a year. Had  
we grown at 3% instead, last year’s gross 
domestic product per person would have 
been $15,000 higher. That would help pay 
for much of what we need to do as a nation. 
Economic growth will repair the fraying 
of the American dream, particularly if we 
share the wealth by improving education 
and wages for lower-paid citizens. There 
are many effective ways to do this, such as 
raising minimum wages and expanding the 
earned-income tax credit. We must also fix 
the immigration policies that are tearing us 
apart, dramatically reducing illegal immi-
gration and dramatically increasing legal 
immigration. Economic growth will reduce 
inflation, reduce the deficit, and make it 
easier to afford the strong military we need. 
We aren’t going to have the economic 
growth we need with the legal, regulatory 
and bureaucratic system we have today.
Global trade will necessarily be restruc-
tured so that we don’t rely on potential  
adversaries for critical goods and services. 
This will require more “industrial plan-
ning” than America is used to—and we 
must ensure it is properly done and is not 
used for political purposes. Yet America 
should also open its arms, through trade 
and aid, to all other nations. Most develop-
ing countries would prefer to align eco-
nomically with the West if we help them 
solve their problems. We should develop a 
new strategic and economic framework to 
make ourselves their partner of choice.
• Deal with China thoughtfully and 
without fear. America still has an enor-
mously strong hand—plenty of food, water 
and energy; peaceful neighbors; and what 
is still the most prosperous and dynamic 
economy the world has ever seen, with a 
per person GDP of over $75,000 a year.  
We can have faith that our system will 
maintain the economic dynamism we need. 
China has done a great job lifting up its  
nation and bringing its GDP per person up 
to $13,000 a year. Yet any fair assessment 
must recognize its challenges—not enough 
food, water and energy; a very complex 
geopolitical situation with tough neighbors; 
a lack of freedom that creates economic  
rigidity and malinvestment.
Whether you think it is a competitor or a 
potential adversary, we, along with our  
allies, should firmly negotiate with China 
(where my company and its predecessor 
firms have done business for more than a 
century). We should acknowledge that we 
have common interests in combating  
nuclear proliferation, climate change and 
terrorism. Tough but thoughtful negotia-
tions over strategic, military and economic 
concerns—including unfair competition—
should yield a better situation for all. If 
America leads well, China will be better 
off forming partnerships with a strong 
Western world than with Russia, Iran and 
other such nations.
Together, we can ensure America’s lead-
ership for the next 100 years.

The West Needs America’s Leadership
How the U.S. can marshal its strengths—not only military but also moral, economic and diplomatic
Originally published in The Wall Street Journal on January 3, 2023. Reprinted with permission.
CREATING A COMPREHENSIVE GLOBAL 
ECONOMIC STRATEGY
Just as we need a comprehensive military strategy, 
globally, to deal with future security risks, we need 
a comprehensive global economic strategy to deal 
with future economic risks. Done properly, this will 
help strengthen and coalesce the Western demo-
cratic alliances over an extended period of time. 
This strategy has four pillars. 
First, we need a U.S. growth strategy.
Between 2000 and 2022, real U.S. GDP grew at an 
average rate of only 2% a year. Had we grown at 
3% instead, last year’s GDP per person would have 
been $15,000 higher. That would help pay for much 
of what we need to do as a nation. We simply have 
not focused enough on growing the U.S. economy. 
In prior letters, we have spoken about how we 
need to get public policy right to address a multi-
tude of areas, which span ineffective education 
systems, soaring healthcare costs, excessive regu-
lation and bureaucracy, the inability to plan and 
build infrastructure efficiently, inequitable taxes, a 
capricious and wasteful litigation system, frustrat-
ing immigration policies and reform, inefficient 
mortgage markets and housing markets and hous-
ing policy, a partially untrained and unprepared 
labor force, excessive student debt, and the lack of 
proper federal government budgeting and spend-
ing. I believe that our poor policies have restrained 
our growth, and simply improving those policies 
would accelerate our growth. 
We should also focus on reducing the worker 
shortages by allowing both more merit-based 
immigration and seasonal immigration. Reducing 
trade barriers could also have a rapid effect, and 
decreasing regulations and bureaucracy would be 
helpful. For example, starting a small business 
today generally requires multiple licenses, which 
take precious months to get. But it doesn’t end 
there. Talk with any small business owner, and that 
person will describe the mountains of red tape, 
inefficient systems and huge amount of documen-
tation involved to operate the business. We need 
to reduce the burdens that are imposed on those 
who want to open and run a small business.
By seeking a bold, comprehensive approach, we 
increase our ability to positively impact economic 
growth and jobs; in fact, this is also the best way to 
reduce inflation and the deficit. 
Second, an industrial policy, done properly, 
could drive growth and also protect our 
national security.
The United States has essentially never had an 
“industrial policy,” a strategy by which the federal 
government, through incentives and policies, 
drives American industry. We have done it indi-
rectly through things like the Defense Advanced 
Research Projects Agency and NASA’s moon mis-
sion but not generally by favoring industries. More 
directly, the IRA and the CHIPS Act provide specific 
incentives for EVs, semiconductors, rare earths, 
alternative energy sources and others. There are 
two reasons we should develop an industrial policy: 
1) specifically to safeguard our national security and 
2) to counter unfair economic competition, particu-
larly where our national security is directly con-
cerned. For example, making bicycles would not be 
part of the second example. But China, using subsi-
dies and its economic muscle to dominate batteries, 
rare earths, semiconductors or EVs, could eventu-
ally imperil national security by disrupting our 
access to these products and materials. We cannot 
cede these important resources and capabilities  
to another country.
Crafting an industrial policy should be done properly 
and with a tightly restricted scope. If the policy is 
politically motivated, it will be used to benefit vari-
ous political benefactors and eventually provoke 
extreme misallocation of capital and corruption. 
Managing the economy is extremely complex, and 
Adam Smith’s invisible hand still prevails — in a 
way we can never understand. If the government 
starts to micromanage through an industrial policy, 
it will not stop, and much of the efficiencies meant 
to be created will not be realized. Industrial policy 
should come with twins — very strict limitations on 
political interference and related comprehensive 
policy around factors like permitting require-
ments, which if not drastically improved will inhibit 
our ability to make investments and allow infra-
structure to be built. 
40
OUR SERIOUS NEED FOR MORE EFFECTIVE PUBLIC POLICY AND COMPETENT GOVERNMENT
Third, fixing income inequality will reignite the 
American dream.
Of all the policy errors we need to remedy in Amer-
ica, there are two that I believe will have a dramatic 
effect on growth and equality — and go a long way 
toward repairing the frayed American dream. The 
first is providing graduating students and other 
individuals with work skills (in fields such as 
advanced manufacturing, cyber, data science and 
technology, healthcare and so on) that will lead to 
better paying jobs. This would be good for growth 
and much that ails us. And we know what to do. 
High schools and community colleges should  
work with local businesses to create specific skills- 
training programs, internships and apprenticeships 
that prepare graduating students to be job ready — 
whether they go on to earn a credential, to work or 
to attend college. With 10.8 million job openings 
and 5.9 million unemployed workers in the United 
States, work-skills training has never been needed 
more. Businesses must be involved in this process, 
and programs need to be offered locally because 
that is where the actual jobs are.
The second step is related to the first: Get more 
income to lower-paid workers. The gap between 
skilled and unskilled workers has been growing 
dramatically — so much so that unskilled labor has 
become less and less a “living wage.” Of the 150 
million Americans working today, approximately 
21 million are paid less than $15 per hour. It is 
hard to live on $15 an hour, particularly for fami-
lies (even if two household members are working). 
But all jobs should be treated with respect. Jobs 
and living wages bring dignity, lead to more 
opportunity — in housing, education, childcare, 
health and overall well-being — and also help 
rebuild communities as that income is used to 
improve how people live. 
A major step would be to expand the Earned 
Income Tax Credit (EITC), which many Democrats 
and Republicans already agree upon. Today, the 
EITC supplements low- to moderate-income  
working individuals and couples, particularly with 
children. For example, a single mother with two 
children earning $9 an hour (approximately 
$20,000 a year) could receive a tax credit of  
more than $6,000 at year’s end. Workers without 
children receive a very small tax credit — this 
should be dramatically expanded, too — and  
personally, I would eliminate the child requirement 
altogether. Last year, the EITC program cost the 
United States about $64 billion, and 31 million  
individuals received the credit. We should convert 
the EITC to make it more like a negative income 
payroll tax, paid monthly. Many people who are 
eligible for this benefit do not get it (often because 
they do not know about it). Proper reform of this 
program could increase benefits where deserved 
and reduce fraudulent and improper payments. 
Any tax credit income should not be offset by any 
other benefits these individuals already receive.
I have little doubt that this would do more than 
anything else to lift up lower-income neighbor-
hoods as the money is spent on lifting up their 
families. I also have little doubt that this would add 
to GDP — because most of this money would, in 
fact, be spent. 
Fourth, America must take the lead on 
devising a comprehensive global economic 
strategy.
In an op-ed published by The Wall Street Journal 
earlier this year, I wrote: “Only America has the full 
capability to lead and coalesce the Western world, 
though we must do so respectfully and in partner-
ship with our allies. Without cohesiveness and 
unity with our allies, autocratic forces will divide 
and conquer the bickering West. America needs to 
lead with its strengths—not only military but also 
economic, diplomatic and moral.”

OUR SERIOUS NEED FOR MORE EFFECTIVE PUBLIC POLICY AND COMPETENT GOVERNMENT
Getting military strategy right isn’t sufficient.  
We must keep the Western alliances together and 
actively appeal to developing nations. A compre-
hensive economic strategy would tighten the 
bonds, strengthen our alliances and, importantly, 
maximize our economic resources. Furthermore, it 
must encompass a global trade and investment 
strategy, a holistic plan around energy security 
and food security, and far more dynamic develop-
ment finance for emerging markets. Done prop-
erly, the economic strength to emerge from such 
collaboration will preserve our alliances, entice

nations such as India into the fold, guarantee the 
strength of the U.S. military and preserve the 
mighty U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency.
Finally, more active diplomacy and more dynamic 
communication around the principles that moti-
vate the Western world are required. These princi-
ples are life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness and 
the idea that all people are created equal. Democ-
racy and human freedom are inseparable from 
freedom of speech, freedom of religion and free 
enterprise. We should loudly and proudly sing 
these values from the rooftops. 
In Closing
I would like to express my deep gratitude and appreciation for the  
290,000+ employees, and their families, of JPMorgan Chase. From this letter,  
I hope shareholders and all readers gain an appreciation for the tremendous 
character and capabilities of our people and how they continue to help 
communities around the world. They have faced these times of adversity with 
grace and fortitude. I hope you are as proud of them as I am. 
Finally, we sincerely hope that all the citizens and countries of the world  
return to normal after the pandemic, see an end to the ongoing war in Ukraine, 
and see a renaissance of a world on the path to peace and democracy.

28 Represents the Nomura “star rating” for Japan-domiciled funds and Morningstar for all other 
domiciled funds. Includes only Asset Management retail open-ended mutual funds that have a 
rating. Excludes money market funds, Undiscovered Managers Fund, and Brazil- and  
Korea-domiciled funds. Mutual fund rating services rank funds based on their risk-adjusted 
performance over various periods. A 5-star rating is the best rating and represents the top 10% 
of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked 
funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating 
represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating and 
represents the bottom 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. The “overall Morningstar rating” is 
derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund’s three-, 
five-and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.-domiciled funds, separate 
star ratings are given at the individual share class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based on 
three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds with fewer than three years of history are not 
rated and hence excluded from this analysis. All ratings and the assigned peer categories used  
to derive this analysis are sourced from these fund rating providers as mentioned. Past 
performance is not indicative of future results.
29 In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Firm realigned certain wealth management clients from AWM

33 All quartile rankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive this 
analysis are sourced from the fund ranking providers. Quartile rankings are done on the 
net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. The data providers re-denominate the asset values into 
U.S. dollars. This % of AUM is based on fund performance and associated peer rankings at the 
share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, at a “primary share class” level to represent the 
quartile ranking of U.K., Luxembourg and Hong Kong funds, and at the fund level for all other 
funds. The “primary share class” is defined as C share class for European funds and Acc share 
class for Hong Kong and Taiwan funds. In case the share classes defined are not available, the 
oldest share class is used as the primary share class. The performance data could have been 
different if all share classes would have been included. Past performance is not indicative of 
future results. Effective September 2021, the Firm has changed the peer group ranking source 
from Lipper to Morningstar for U.S.-domiciled funds (except for Municipal and Investor Funds) 
and Taiwan-domiciled funds, to better align these funds to the providers and peer groups it 
believes most appropriately reflects their competitive positioning. This change may positively or 
adversely impact, substantially in some cases, the quartile rankings for one or more of these 
funds as compared with how they would have been ranked by Lipper for this reporting period or 
future reporting periods. The source for determining the rankings for all other funds remains the 
same. The classifications in terms of product suites and product engines shown are J.P. Morgan’s 
own and are based on internal investment management structures.

group as follows: Allianz, Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon, BlackRock, Charles Schwab, 
Credit Suisse, DWS, Franklin Templeton, Goldman Sachs, Invesco, Morgan Stanley, State Street, 
T. Rowe Price and UBS. JPMorgan Chase ranking reflects Asset & Wealth Management client 
assets, U.S. Wealth Management investments and new-to-firm Chase Private Client deposits.

Consumer Banking (BAC-CB), Goldman Sachs Investment Banking and Global Markets  
(GS-IB & GM), Wells Fargo & Company Commercial Banking (WFC-CB) and Morgan Stanley 
Wealth Management and Investment Management (MS-WM & IM). WFC-CB is the only G-SIB peer 
to disclose a comparable business segment to Commercial Banking.

across peers may be inconsistent with JPM’s.

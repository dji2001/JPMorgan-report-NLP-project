Dear Fellow Shareholders,
I begin this letter with a sense of gratitude and pride about JPMorgan Chase that 
has only grown stronger over the course of the last decade. Ours is an exceptional 
company with an extraordinary heritage and a promising future. 
Throughout a period of profound political and economic change around the world, 
our company has been steadfast in our dedication to the clients, communities and 
countries we serve while earning a fair return for our shareholders. 
2016 was another breakthrough year for our company. We earned a record $24.7 billion 
in net income on revenue 1 of $99.1 billion, reflecting strong underlying performance 
across our businesses. We have delivered record results in six out of the last seven 
years, and we hope to continue to deliver in the future. 
Our stock price is a measure of the progress we have made over the years. This 
progress is a function of continually making important investments, in good times and 
not so good times, to build our capabilities — people, systems and products. These

investments drive the future prospects of our company and position it to grow and 
prosper for decades. Whether looking back over five years, 10 years or since the Bank 
One/JPMorgan Chase merger (approximately 12 years ago), our stock has significantly 
outperformed the Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 500 and the S&P Financials Index. And this 
is during a time of unprecedented challenges for banks — both the Great Recession and

the extraordinarily difficult legal, regulatory and political environments that followed. 
We have long contended that these factors explained why bank stock price/earnings 
ratios were appropriately depressed. And we believe the anticipated reversal of many 
negatives and the expectation of a more business-friendly environment, coupled with 
our sustained, strong business results, are among the reasons our stock price has done 
so well this past year. 
As you know, we believe tangible book value per share is a good measure of the value 
we have created for our shareholders. If we believe our asset and liability values are 
appropriate — and we do — and if we believe we can continue to deploy this capital at 
an approximate 15% return on tangible equity, which we do, then our company should 
ultimately be worth considerably more than tangible book value. If you look at the 
chart below, you’ll see that tangible book value “anchors” the stock price.
In the last five years, we have bought back $25.7 billion in stock. In prior years, I have 
explained why buying back our stock at tangible book value per share was a no-
brainer. While the first and most important use of capital is to invest in growth, buying 
back stock should also be considered when you are generating excess capital. We do

Tangible book value over time captures the company’s use of capital, balance sheet and profitability. In this chart, we are looking at 
heritage Bank One shareholders and JPMorgan Chase & Co. shareholders. The chart shows the increase in tangible book value per share;  
it is an after-tax number assuming all dividends were retained vs. the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500), which is a pre-tax number 
with dividends reinvested.
1 On March 27, 2000, Jamie Dimon was hired as CEO of Bank One.
currently have excess capital. Five years ago, we offered the example of our buying 
back stock at tangible book value and having earnings per share and tangible book 
value per share substantially higher than they otherwise would have been just four 
years later. While we prefer buying our stock at tangible book value, we think it makes 
sense to do so at or around two times tangible book value for reasons similar to those 
we’ve expressed in the past. If we buy back a big block of stock this year (using analyst 
earnings estimates for the next five years), we would expect earnings per share in five 
years to be 3%—4% higher, and tangible book value would be virtually unchanged. 
In this letter, I discuss the issues highlighted on the next page — which describe many 
of our successes and opportunities, as well as our challenges and responses. Like last 
year’s letter, we have organized much of the content around some of the key questions 
we have received from shareholders and other interested parties. 
6
I.  
The JPMorgan Chase franchise
1. 
Why do we consider our four major business franchises strong and market leading? 
2. 
Why are we optimistic about our future growth opportunities?
3. 
What are some technology and fintech initiatives that you’re most excited about? 
4. 
How do we protect customers and their sensitive information while enabling them 
to share data? 
5. 
What are your biggest geopolitical risks?
6. 
Although banks and other large companies remain unpopular with some people, 
you often say how proud you are of JPMorgan Chase. Why?  
II.  Regulatory reform
1. 
Talk about the strength and safety of the financial system and whether Too Big  
to Fail has been solved. 
2. 
How and why should capital rules be changed?
3. 
How do certain regulatory policies impact money markets?
4. 
How has regulation affected monetary policy, the flow of bank credit and the 
 growth of the economy? 
5. 
How can we reform mortgage markets to give qualified borrowers access to the 
credit they need? 
6. 
How can we reduce complexity and create a more coherent regulatory system?
7. 
How can we harmonize regulations across the globe?
III.  Public policy
1. 
The United States of America is truly an exceptional country.
2. 
But it is clear that something is wrong — and it’s holding us back.
3. 
How can we start investing in our people to help them be more productive and 
share in the opportunities and rewards of our economy?
4. 
What should our country be doing to invest in its infrastructure? How does the lack 
of a plan and investment hurt our economy?
5. 
How should the U.S. legal and regulatory systems be reformed to incentivize 
investment and job creation?
6. 
What price are we paying for the lack of understanding about business and  
free enterprise?
7. 
Strong collaboration is needed between business and government.

1. Why do we consider our four major business franchises strong and market leading?
The chart below and those on page 8 speak 
for themselves. Looking closely at the actual 
numbers, it’s clear that every business is 
among the top performers financially – 
whether you look at efficiency (overhead 
ratios) or return on equity (ROE) vs. the best 
in that business. More important, customer 
satisfaction is at the center of everything 
we do. Each business has gained market 
share – which is possible only when you are 
improving customer satisfaction and your 
I. THE JPMORGAN CHASE FRANCHISE 
products and services relative to the competi-
tion. And each business continues to inno-
vate, from customer-facing apps, to straight-
through processing, to digitized trading 
services or payment systems. Our business 
leaders do a great job describing their busi-
nesses, and I strongly encourage you to read 
their letters following this year’s Letter to 
Shareholders. Each will give you a feel for 
why we are optimistic about our future.

I.  THE JPMORGAN CHASE FRANCHISE 
2. Why are we optimistic about our future growth opportunities?
We believe we have substantial opportuni-
ties in the decades ahead to drive organic 
growth in our company. We have confidence 
in the underlying growth in the U.S. and 
global economies, which will fuel the growth 
in our customer base – consumer deposits, 
assets under management and small to large 
clients globally. This growth will obviously 
be faster in emerging markets than in devel-
oped markets – and we are well-positioned 
to serve both. In addition, we believe we 
can continue to gain share in many markets 
and, over time, add new, relevant products. 
This can drive organic growth for years. 
Capturing this growth is very basic:
•� Selectively adding investment bankers 
and private bankers around the world
•� Bringing consumer and commercial 
banking branches and capabilities to more 
places in the United States
•� Adding wholesale branches overseas and 
carefully expanding into new countries
•� Adding wholesale and Private Bank clients 
as they grow into our target space
Equally important is using technology and 
fintech to do a better job serving clients and 
to grow our businesses – with better products 
and services. You can read more about our 
big data, machine learning, payment systems, 
cybersecurity and electronic trading on pages 
47–68 described by our senior executives. But 
I do want to highlight a few items in the next 
question that pertain to these topics.
3. What are some technology and fintech initiatives that you’re most excited about?
One of the reasons we’re performing well as 
a company is we never stopped investing in 
technology – this should never change. In 
2016, we spent more than $9.5 billion in  
technology firmwide, of which approxi-
mately $3 billion is dedicated toward new 
initiatives. Of that amount, approximately 
$600 million is spent on emerging fintech 
solutions – which include building and 
improving digital and mobile services and 
partnering with fintech companies. The 
reasons we invest so much in technology 
(whether it’s digital, big data or machine 
learning) are simple: to benefit customers 
with better, faster and often cheaper prod-
ucts and services, to reduce errors and to 
make the firm more efficient.
We are developing great new products. 
We are currently developing some exciting 
new products and services, which we will be 
adding to our suite and rolling out later this 
year, including: 
•� End-to-end digital banking – The ability to 
open an account and complete the majority 
of transactions on a mobile phone.
•� Investment advice and self-directed 
investing – Online vehicles for both indi-
vidual retirement and non-retirement 
accounts, providing easy-to-use (and 
inexpensive) automated advice, as well as 
enabling our customers to buy and sell 
stocks and bonds, etc. (again inexpensively).
•� Electronic trading and other online services 
(e.g., cash management) in our Corporate 
& Investment Bank and Asset & Wealth 
Management businesses – Offering our 
clients a more robust digital platform.

I.  THE JPMORGAN CHASE FRANCHISE 
We are investing in data and technology to 
improve the financial health of low-income 
households. 
Over the last two years, the JPMorgan Chase 
Institute has helped identify some of the 
most pressing financial challenges facing 
American households, such as their difficulty 
managing income and expense volatility. 
We are using that data to select and support 
innovative fintech companies and nonprofits 
that are designing solutions to address these 
challenges. One example of these efforts 
is JPMorgan Chase’s Financial Solutions 
Lab, which, in partnership with the Center 
for Financial Services Innovation, seeks to 
facilitate the next generation of fintech prod-
ucts to help consumers manage their daily 
finances and meet their long-term goals. 
Highlights of the initiative include: 
•� To date, the Lab has helped support more 
than 18 fintech companies working to 
improve the financial health of more than 
1 million Americans. One example is Digit, 
an automated savings tool that identi-
fies small amounts of money that can be 
moved into savings based on spending 
and income. To date, it has helped Ameri-
cans save more than $350 million.
•� Lab winners have raised more than $100 
million in follow-on capital.
•� In 2017, we launched a new competition 
seeking innovative fintech solutions to 
promote the financial health of popula-
tions often overlooked, such as people of 
color, individuals with disabilities and low-
income women. 
We are successfully collaborating with other 
companies to deliver fintech solutions.
Whether it is consumer payment systems 
(Zelle), mortgages (Roostify), auto finance 
(TrueCar), small business lending (OnDeck 
Capital) or communications systems 
(Symphony), we are successfully collabo-
rating with some excellent fintech companies 
to dramatically improve our digital and other 
customer offerings. I’d like to highlight just 
two new exciting areas:
•� Developer Services API store – By 
providing direct interfaces with our appli-
cations (fully controlled, of course), we are 
enabling entrepreneurs, partners, fintech 
companies and clients to build new prod-
ucts or services dedicated to specific needs.
•� Bill payment and business services – 
While I can’t reveal much at the moment, 
suffice it to say there are some interesting 
developments coming as we integrate our 
capabilities with those of other companies.
4. How do we protect customers and their sensitive information while enabling them to share data?
For years, we have been describing the risks 
– to banks and customers – that arise when 
customers freely give away their bank pass-
codes to third-party services, allowing virtu-
ally unlimited access to their data. Customers 
often do not know the liability this may 
create for them, if their passcode is misused, 
and, in many cases, they do not realize how 
their data are being used. For example, access 
to the data may continue for years after 
customers have stopped using the third-party 
services. 
We recently completed a new arrangement 
with Intuit, which we think represents 
an important step forward. In addition to 
protecting the bank, the customers and 
even the third party (in this case, Intuit), it 
allows customers to share data – how and 
when they want. Under this arrangement, 
customers can choose whatever they would 
like to share and opting to turn these selec-
tions on or off as they see fit. The data will 
be “pushed” to Intuit, eliminating the need 
for sharing bank passcodes, which protects 
the bank and our customers and reduces 
potential liabilities on Intuit’s part as well. 
We are hoping this sets a new standard for 
data-sharing relationships.

5. What are your biggest geopolitical risks?
Banks have to manage a lot of risks – from 
credit and trading risks to technological, 
operational, conduct and cybersecurity risks. 
But in addition to those, we have exposures 
around the world, which are subject to 
normal cyclical and recession risks, as well  
as to complex geopolitical risks.
There are always geopolitical risks, and 
you can rest assured we are continuously 
reviewing, analyzing and stress testing them 
to ensure that our company can endure them. 
We always try to make certain that we can 
handle the worst of all cases – importantly, 
without disrupting the effective operation of 
the company and its service to our clients. We 
think these geopolitical risks currently are in 
a heightened state – that is, beyond what we 
might consider normal. There are two specific 
risks I want to point out:
Brexit and the increasing risk to the European 
Union (EU). 
Regarding Brexit, a key concern is to make 
sure our company is prepared to support our 
clients on day one – the first day after the 
actual Brexit occurs, approximately two years 
from now. We are confident we will be able 
to develop and expand the capabilities that 
our EU subsidiaries and branches will need 
to serve our clients properly in Europe under 
EU law. This will require acquiring regulatory 
approvals, transferring certain technologies 
and moving some people. On day one, we 
need to perform all of our critical functions 
at our standards. For example, underwriting 
debt and equity, moving money and accepting 
deposits, and safeguarding the custody assets 
for all of our European clients, including 
many sovereigns themselves. We must be 
prepared to do this assuming a hard exit by 
the United Kingdom – it would be irrespon-
sible to presume otherwise. While this does 
not entail moving many people in the next 
two years, we do suspect that following Brexit, 
there will be constant pressure by the EU not 
to “outsource” services to the United Kingdom 
but to continue to move people and capabili-
ties into EU subsidiaries.
We hope that the advent of Brexit would lead 
the EU to focus on fixing its issues – immi-
gration, bureaucracy, the ongoing loss of 
sovereign rights and labor inflexibility – and 
thereby pulling the EU and the monetary 
union closer together. Our fear, however, is 
that it could instead result in political unrest 
that would force the EU to split apart. The 
unraveling of the EU and the monetary union 
could have devastating economic and political 
effects. While we are not predicting this will 
happen, the probabilities have certainly gone 
up – and we will keep a close eye on the situa-
tion in Europe over the next several years. 
De-globalization, Mexico and China.
Anti-globalization sentiment is growing in 
parts of the world today, usually expressing 
itself in anti-trade and anti-immigration posi-
tions. (I’m not going to write about immigra-
tion in this letter – we have always supported 
proper immigration – it is a vital part of the 
strength of America, and, properly done, it 
enhances the economy and the vitality of 
the country.) We do not believe globalization 
will reverse course – we believe trade has 
been absolutely critical for growth around 
the world and has benefited billions of 
people. While there are some issues with our 
trade policies that need to be fixed, poorly 
conceived anti-trade policies could be quite 
disruptive, particularly with two of our key 
trading partners: Mexico and China. 
The trade deal with Mexico through NAFTA 
is simpler than the one with China. (In full 
disclosure, JPMorgan Chase is a major inter-
national bank in Mexico, with revenue of 
more than $400 million, serving Mexican, 
American and international clients who do 
business there.) Mexico is a long-standing 
peaceful neighbor, and it is wholly in our 
country’s interest that Mexico be a pros-
perous nation. This actually reduces immi-
gration issues (there are now more Mexicans 
12
12
I.  THE JPMORGAN CHASE FRANCHISE 
going back to Mexico than coming into the 
United States). Our trade agreement with 
Mexico helps ensure that the young democ-
racy in Mexico is not hijacked by populist 
and anti-American leaders (like Chavez did 
in Venezuela). While there are some clear, 
identifiable problems with NAFTA, I believe 
they will be worked out in a way that is fair 
and beneficial for both sides. The logic to do 
so is completely compelling.
China is far more complex. (Again, in full 
disclosure, we have a major international 
presence in China, with revenue of approxi-
mately $700 million, serving Chinese, 
American and international clients who do 
business in that country.) The United States 
has some serious trade issues with China, 
which have grown over the years – from 
cybersecurity and the protection of intel-
lectual property to tariffs, non-tariff trade 
barriers and non-fulfillment of World Trade 
Organization obligations. However, there 
is no inevitable or compelling reason that 
China and America have to clash – in fact, 
improving political and economic relation-
ships can be good for both parties. So while 
the issues here are not easy, I am hopeful 
they can be resolved in a way that is fair and 
constructive for the two countries.
6. Although banks and other large companies remain unpopular with some people, you often 
say how proud you are of JPMorgan Chase. Why? 
I firmly believe the qualities embedded in 
JPMorgan Chase today – the knowledge and 
cohesiveness of our people, our deep client 
relationships, our technology, our strategic 
thinking and our global presence – cannot 
be replicated. While we take nothing for 
granted, as long as we continue to do our 
jobs well and continue to drive our company 
forward, we think we can be a leader for our 
industry and the communities we serve for 
decades to come. There are times when I 
am bursting with pride with what we have 
accomplished for our clients, communities 
and countries around the world – let me 
count (some of) the ways:
We are strong and steadfast and are there for our 
clients in good times and bad. 
In the toughest of times, we maintained 
a healthy and vibrant company that was 
able to do its job – we did not need govern-
ment support and, in fact, we consistently 
provided credit and capital to our clients and 
assistance to our government throughout 
the crisis. I want to remind our shareholders 
that we continued to lend not at the much 
higher prevailing market rates at that time 
but at existing bank rates. These were far 
below market rates because our clients relied 
on us – we were their lender of last resort. 
JPMorgan Chase was and will be a Rock of 
Gibraltar in the best and worst of times for 
our clients around the world.

We have extraordinary capabilities — both our 
people and our technology. 
Ultimately, our people are our most impor-
tant assets – and they are exceptional. Their 
knowledge, their capabilities and their 
relationships are what drive everything else, 
including our technology and our innovation. 
They partner well with each other around 
the world, and they are deeply trusted by our 
clients and within our communities. We all 
owe them an enormous debt. They are the 
ones accomplishing all the things you are 
reading about in this Annual Report.
Our fortress balance sheet and the strength 
of our people were never more vividly 
evident than during the darkest hours of the 
financial crisis. I was in awe of the tremen-
dous effort our people made (thousands 
of people, seven days a week for months)

to acquire and assimilate Bear Stearns and 
Washington Mutual – thereby saving 30,000 
jobs and avoiding the devastation of commu-
nities that would have happened if those 
companies had been allowed to fail. Our 
company went above and beyond the call of 
duty during the height of the crisis, including 
lending $87 billion to a bankrupt Lehman 
to facilitate, as much as possible, an orderly 
unwind of its assets. In those dark days, we 
were the only bank willing to commit to 
lending $4 billion to the state of California, 
$2 billion to the state of New Jersey and $1 
billion to the state of Illinois to keep those 
states strong. None of these actions had to 
be taken, and they were made at some risk 
to JPMorgan Chase. We simply were acting 
to do our part to try to stop the crisis from 
getting worse.
We try to be outstanding corporate citizens. 
We believe in being great corporate citizens 
– in how we treat our employees and care 
for our clients and communities. Let me give 
some examples to illustrate this point:
•� We�compensate�our�employees�fairly�
and�provide�extraordinary�benefits�and�
training.�We value our employees at 
JPMorgan Chase, and we are committed 
to helping them succeed. This past year, 
we announced that we will increase our 
minimum wages – mostly for entry-level 
bank tellers and customer service repre-
sentatives – to between $12.00 and $16.50 
an hour (depending on where these 
employees live). This will increase wages 
for approximately 18,000 employees. 
We believe this pay increase is the right 
thing to do, and, above all, it enables more 
people to begin to share in the rewards

of our success. Remember, many of these 
employees soon move on to even higher 
paying jobs. 
We will also continue to invest in 
employee benefits and training opportu-
nities so that our workers can continue 
to increase their skills and advance their 
careers. Our comprehensive benefits 
package, including healthcare and retire-
ment savings, on average, is valued at 
$11,000 per year. Our total investment in 
training and development is approximately 
$325 million a year. Together, these efforts 
help our employees support their fami-
lies, advance their careers and promote 
economic growth in our communities.
•� We�have�a�diverse�workforce.�We have 
more than 243,000 employees globally with 
over 167,000 in the United States. Women 
represent 50% of our employees. Recently, 
Oliver Wyman, a leading global manage-
ment consulting firm, issued a report 
stating that it would be 30 years before 
women reach 30% Executive Committee 
representation within global financial 
services. So you might be surprised to find 
out that women already represent 30% of 
my direct reports and approximately 30% 
of our company’s senior leadership globally. 
They run major businesses – several units 
on their own would be among Fortune 
1000 companies. In addition to having 
three women on our Operating Committee 
– who run Asset & Wealth Management, 
Finance and Legal – some of our other busi-
nesses and functions headed by women 
include Consumer Banking, Credit Card, 
U.S. Private Bank, U.S. Mergers & Acquisi-
tions, Global Equity Capital Markets,  
Global Research, Regulatory Affairs, Global  
Philanthropy, our U.S. branch network,  
our Controller and firmwide Marketing.  
I believe we have some of the best women 
leaders in the corporate world globally. In 
addition to gender diversity, 48% of our 
firm’s population is ethnically diverse in 
the United States, and we are in more than 
60 countries around the world. Diversity 
means running a company where people 
are respected, trusted and given equal 
opportunity to contribute and raise their 
ideas and voices. 
But there is one area in particular where 
we simply have not met the standards 
JPMorgan Chase has set for itself – and that 
is in increasing African-American talent 
at the firm. While we think our effort to 
attract and retain black talent is as good 
as at most other companies, it simply is 
not good enough. Therefore, in 2016, we 
introduced a new firmwide initiative called 
Advancing Black Leaders. This initiative is 
dedicated to helping us better attract and 
recruit external black talent while retaining 
and developing the talent within the 
company. And we are proud of our efforts 
this past year – we increased the number of 
black employees at the officer level (through 
both internal promotions and external new 
hires), we focused on the pipeline of junior 
talent, and we increased the number at the 
senior officer and vice president level. We 
plan to continue to make progress on this 
front in the years to come. 
•� We�are�proud�of�how�we�are�helping�
veterans.�We want to continue to update 
you on how JPMorgan Chase has helped 
position military members, veterans and 
their families. Our program is centered on 
facilitating success in their post-service 
lives primarily through employment and 
retention. In 2011, JPMorgan Chase and 
10 other companies launched the 100,000 
Jobs Mission, setting a goal of collectively 
hiring 100,000 veterans. The initiative 
now includes more than 200 companies, 
has collectively hired nearly 400,000 
veterans, and is focused on collectively 
hiring 1 million people. JPMorgan Chase 
alone has hired more than 11,000 veterans 
since 2011. We hope you feel as good 
about this initiative as we do.
•� We�have�accomplished�an�extraordinary�
amount�in�our�Corporate�Responsibility�
efforts. We take this responsibility very 
seriously, and, over the last decade, not 
only have we more than doubled our 
philanthropic giving from approximately 
16
16
I.  THE JPMORGAN CHASE FRANCHISE 
$100 million to approximately $250 
million in 2016, but we have dramati-
cally increased our support with human 
capital, collaboration, data and manage-
ment expertise. Our head of Corporate 
Responsibility talks about our significant 
measures in more detail in his letter, but 
I will highlight two initiatives below:
 − We provide tremendous support 
to cities and communities – espe-
cially those left behind – and the 
best example is our work in Detroit.�
JPMorgan Chase has been doing busi-
ness in Detroit for more than 80 years, 
and we watched as this iconic American 
city was engulfed in economic turmoil 
after years of decline. Just as Detroit 
was declaring bankruptcy, our company 
redoubled its efforts to help and, in 
2014, announced our most comprehen-
sive initiative to date – a $100 million 
investment in Detroit to help accelerate 
the city’s recovery. 
We are making strategic, coordinated 
investments focused on creating 
economically inclusive and revital-
ized neighborhoods, preparing people 
with the skills needed for today’s 
high-quality jobs and providing small 
businesses with the capital they need 
to grow and succeed. This includes our 
investment in the Strategic Neighbor-
hoods Fund, which brings together 
community developers and dedicated 
resources to create and maintain afford-
able housing and deliver services to 
targeted communities. We also seeded 
the city’s first nonprofit real estate 
development firm focused exclusively 
on creating and preserving affordable 
housing in Detroit’s neighborhoods. In 
2015, we helped create the $6.5 million 
Entrepreneurs of Color Fund with the 
Kellogg Foundation and Detroit Devel-
opment Fund to bring critical financing 
and technical assistance to underserved 
minority- and community-based small 
businesses. In its first year, the Fund 
deployed almost $3 million in capital 
through more than 30 loans. We are 
also putting our talented employees 
to work in Detroit through the Detroit 
Service Corps. Since 2014, 68 JPMorgan 
Chase employees from 10 countries 
dedicated three intensive weeks to 
16 Detroit nonprofits, helping them 
analyze challenges, solve problems 
and improve their chances for success. 
Detroit is making incredible progress 
as a result of the unprecedented spirit 
of engagement and cooperation among 
the city’s leaders, business commu-
nity and nonprofit sectors. JPMorgan 
Chase is proud to be part of Detroit’s 
resurgence, and we believe a thriving 
Detroit economy will become a shining 
example of American resilience and 
ingenuity at work.
 − And more broadly, we created solutions 
for one of our country’s biggest chal-
lenges – training the world’s work-
force in the skills needed to compete 
in today’s economy. Through several 
targeted initiatives, JPMorgan Chase is 
investing over $325 million in demand-
driven workforce development initia-
tives around the world. Our programs 
build stronger labor markets that 
create economic opportunity, focusing 
on middle-skill jobs – positions that 
require a high school education, and 
often specialized training or certifica-
tions, but not a college degree. These 
jobs – surgical technologists, diesel 
mechanics, help desk technicians 
and more – offer good wages and the 
chance to move up the economic ladder. 
Our goal is to increase the number of 
workers who have access to career path-
ways, whether they are adults looking 
to develop new skills or younger 
workers starting to prepare for careers 
during high school and ending with 
postsecondary degrees or credentials 
aligned with good-paying, high-demand 
jobs. We are very proud that we can be 
a bridge between businesses and job 
seekers to support an economy that 
creates opportunity for everyone.

II.
We had a severe financial crisis followed 
by needed reform, and our financial system 
is now stronger and more resilient as a 
result. During and since the crisis, we’ve 
always supported thoughtful, effective 
regulation, not simply more or less. But it 
is an understatement to say improvements 
could be made. The regulatory environ-
ment is unnecessarily complex, costly and 
sometimes confusing. No rational person 
could think that everything that was done 
was good, fair, sensible and effective, or 
coherent and consistent in creating a safer 
and stronger system. We believe (and many 
studies show) that poorly conceived and 
uncoordinated regulations have damaged 
our economy, inhibiting growth and jobs – 
and this has hurt the average American. We 
are not looking to throw out the entirety of 
Dodd-Frank or other rules (many of which 
were not specifically prescribed in Dodd-
Frank). It is, however, appropriate to open 
up the rulebook in the light of day and 
rework the rules and regulations that don’t 
work well or are unnecessary. Rest assured, 
we will be responsibly and reasonably 
engaged on this front. We believe changes 
can and should be made that preserve 
the safety and soundness of the financial 
system and lead to a more healthy and 
vibrant economy for the benefit of all. 
There are some basic principles that should guide 
responsible regulation:
•� Coherence of rules to be coordinated both 
within and across regulatory agencies
•� Global harmonization of regulation to 
enhance fair trade and competition while 
helping eliminate any weak links in the 
global system
•� Simplified and proper risk-based capital 
standards
•� Consistent and transparent capital and 
liquidity rules
•� Regular and rigorous regulatory review, 
including consideration of costs vs. bene-
fits, efficiencies, competitiveness, reduc-
tion of redundant costs and assessment of 
impact on economic growth 
Adhering to these principles will maximize 
safety and soundness, increase competition 
and improve economic health.
Since the financial crisis, thousands of new 
rules and regulations have been put into 
place by multiple regulators in the United 
States and around the world. An already 
complex system of financial oversight and 
supervision has grown even more complex 
– and this complexity can sometimes create 
even more risk. Many of these rules and 
regulations should be examined and possibly 
modified, but I will focus on the few that are 
critical in response to some of the questions 
and topics that follow.
REGULATORY REFORM

II.  RegulatoRy RefoRm
1. Talk about the strength and safety of the financial system and whether Too Big to Fail has 
been solved. 
There is no question that the system is safer 
and stronger today, and this is mostly due to 
the following factors:
•� Dramatically higher capital for almost all 
banks (we’ll talk later about how much 
capital is the appropriate amount)
•� Far higher liquidity for almost all banks 
(again, we’ll provide more details later in 
this section) 
•� More disclosure and transparency – both 
to investors and regulators
•� More coordinated oversight within the 
United States and abroad 
•� Far stronger compliance and control 
systems 
•� Laws that allow regulators to step in to 
unwind not only failing banks but invest-
ment banks (this did not exist for invest-
ment banks prior to the financial crisis)
•� The creation of “bail-inable” unsecured 
debt – this converts debt into equity at the 
time of failure, immediately recapitalizing 
the failed bank
•� New rules that prohibit derivatives 
contracts from being voided at bankruptcy 
– this allows derivatives contracts to stay 
in place, creating an orderly transition to 
bankruptcy
•� Stress testing that monitors banks’ balance 
sheets and capital ratios under severely 
adverse scenarios (more on this below)
•� Requirements for banks and investment 
banks to prepare corporate recovery plans 
in the event of a crisis to prevent bank-
ruptcy (these plans did not exist before 
the financial crisis)
These changes taken together not only 
largely eliminate the chance of a major 
bank failing today but also prevent such 
failure from having a threatening domino 
effect on other banks and the economy as a 
whole. And if a major bank does fail, regula-
tors have the necessary tools to manage it 
in an orderly way. Moreover, the banking 
industry itself has an inherent interest in 
the safety and soundness of the financial 
system because if there is a failure, the entire 
industry will be liable for that cost (more on 
that below).
Essentially, Too Big to Fail has been solved — 
taxpayers will not pay if a bank fails.
The American public has the right to 
demand that if a major bank fails, they, as 
taxpayers, would not have to pay for it, and 
the failure wouldn’t unduly harm the U.S. 
economy. In my view, these demands have 
now both been met.
On the first count, if a bank fails, taxpayers 
do not pay. Shareholders and debtholders, 
now due to total loss absorbing capacity 
(TLAC) rules, are at risk for all losses. To add 
belts and suspenders, if all that capital is not 
enough, the next and final line of defense is 
the industry itself, which is legally liable to 
pay any excess losses. (Notably, since 20o7, 
JPMorgan Chase alone has contributed $11.7 
billion to the industry deposit fund.) 
On the second count, a regulatory takeover 
of a major bank would be orderly because 
regulators have the tools to manage it in the 
right way. 
It is instructive to look at what would 
happen if Lehman were to fail in today’s 
regulatory regime. First of all, it is highly 
unlikely the firm would fail because the new 
requirements would mean that instead of 
Lehman’s equity capital being $23 billion, 
which it was in 2007, it would be approxi-
mately $45 billion under today’s capital rules. 
In addition, Lehman would have far stronger 
19
19
II.  RegulatoRy RefoRm
liquidity and “bail-inable” debt. And finally, 
the firm would be forced to raise capital 
much earlier in the process. 
If Lehman failed anyway, regulators would 
now have the legal authority to put the 
firm in receivership (they did not have that 
ability back in 2007–2008). The moment that 
happened, unsecured debt of approximately 
$120 billion would be immediately converted 
to equity. Derivatives contracts would not be 
triggered, and cash would continue to move 
through the pipes of the financial system. In 
other words, due to the living wills, Too Big 
to Fail was solved before any additional rules 
were put in place. (I’m not going to go into 
detail on the living wills but will say that 
while they have some positive elements, they 
have become unnecessarily complex and 
costly, and they need to be simplified.) 
Last, there is a new push for Chapter 14 
bankruptcy for banks, which we at JPMorgan 
Chase support. 
This would provide specialized rules to 
quickly handle bankruptcy for banks. 
Whether a failed bank goes through Chapter 
14, called “bankruptcy,” or Title II, called 
“resolution” – these are essentially the same 
thing – we should make the following point 
perfectly clear to the American people: A 
failed bank means the bank’s board and 
management are discharged, its equity is 
worthless, compensation is clawed back to 
the extent of the law and the bank’s name 
will forever be buried in the Hall of Shame. 
In addition, we should change the term “reso-
lution” – as it sounds as if we are bailing out 
a failing bank (which couldn’t be further 
from the truth). Whatever the term is called, 
it should be made clear that the process 
is the same as bankruptcy in any other 
industry. One lesson from the prior crisis is 
that the American public will not be satisfied 
without “Old Testament Justice.”
But market panic will never disappear entirely, 
and regulations must be flexible enough to allow 
banks to act as a bulwark against it rather than 
forcing financial institutions into a defensive 
crouch that will only make things worse. 
There will be market panic again, and it 
won’t affect just banks – it will affect the 
entire financial marketplace. Remember, 
banks were consistent providers of credit at 
existing prices into the crisis – the market 
was not. During the crisis, many companies 
could not raise money in the public markets, 
many securities did not trade, securities issu-
ances dropped dramatically and many asset 
prices fell to valuation levels that virtually 
anticipated a Great Depression. Last time 
around, banks – in particular (and I say with 
pride) our bank – stood by their customers 
to provide capital and liquidity that helped 
them survive. However, today’s capital and 
liquidity rules have created rigidity that will 
actually hurt banks’ ability to stand against 
the tide as they did during the Great Reces-
sion. This will mean that banks will survive 
the next market panic with plenty of cushion 
that could have been – but may not have 
been – used to help customers, companies 
and communities.
It is in this environment that regulators need 
certain authorities to stop the situation from 
getting worse. One important point: Under 
both Chapter 14 and Title II, there might be 
a short-term need for the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation or the Fed to lend 
money, in the short run with proper collat-
eral, to a failing or failed institution. This is 
because panic can cause a run on the bank, 
and it is far less painful to the economy if 
that bank’s assets are not sold in fire sales. 
This lending is effectively fully secured, and 
no loss should ever be incurred. Again, any 
loss that did occur would be charged back to 
all the banks. This also gives banks an enor-
mous incentive to be in favor of a properly 
designed, safe and sound system. 
Going back to the principles above, putting 
safety and soundness first is clearly correct, 
but regulators also need the ability to take 
into consideration the costs and impact on 
our economy in various scenarios.

2. How and why should capital rules be changed?
We need consistent, transparent, simplified and 
more risk-based capital standards.
A healthy banking system needs consistent 
and transparent capital and liquidity rules 
that are based on simplified and proper 
risk-based standards. This allows banks to 
use capital intelligently and to properly plan 
capital levels over the years. Any rules that 
are capricious or that cause an arbitrary 
reduction in the value of a bank’s capital – 
and the value of the bank overall – can cause 
improper or inefficient risk taking. Finally, 
proper capital rules will allow a bank to do 
its job: to consistently finance the economy, 
in good times and, importantly, in bad times. 
There are more than 20 different major 
capital and liquidity requirements – and 
they often are inconsistent. For example, 
certain liquidity rules force a bank to hold 
an increasing amount of cash, essentially 
deposited at the Fed, but other rules require 
the bank to hold capital against this risk-free 
cash. An extraordinary number of calcula-
tions need to be made as companies try to 
manage to avoid inadvertently violating one 
of the standards – a violation that rarely 
affects safety and soundness. To protect 
themselves, banks build enormous buffers – 
and buffers on top of buffers – or otherwise 
take unnecessary actions to ensure that they 
don’t step over the line. And finally, if we

enter another Great Recession, the need for 
these buffers increases, which inevitably will 
force a bank to reduce its lending.
We have a fortress balance sheet — far more than 
the numbers imply.
The chart on page 20 shows the dramatic 
improvement in our capital and liquidity 
numbers since 2008. Remember, we had 
enough capital and liquidity in 2008 to easily 
handle the crisis that ensued. 
The numbers are even better than they look 
on the chart for the following reasons:
•� In 2008, there was no such thing as 
operational risk capital (not to say there 
wasn’t operational risk but just that 
capital was not applied to it). If you 
measured our capital ratio on the same 
basis as in 2008 (that is, on an apples 
to apples basis), we wouldn’t have just 
12.2% today vs. 7% in 2008 – we would 
have 16.7% today vs. 7% in 2008.
•� Since 2008, the regulatory definition of 
liquidity has been prescribed. Now, only 
deposits at a central bank, Treasuries and 
government-guaranteed mortgage-backed 
securities (plus a limited amount of 
sovereign and corporate bonds) count as 
liquidity. Many securities are not allowed 
to count as liquidity today  – on the theory 
that they can sustain losses and occasion-
ally become illiquid. While maybe not all 
100% of the current value of these securi-
ties should apply toward liquidity require-
ments, they should count for something. If 
you did combine all of these categories as 
liquidity, our liquidity at JPMorgan Chase 
would have gone from $300 billion in 
2008 to $786 billion today. And remember, 
our deposits – theoretically subject to “run 
on the bank” risk – total $1.4 trillion. Even 
in the Great Recession, the worst case for a 
bank was only a 30% loss of its deposits.
•� Finally, when you include long-term debt 
and preferred stock as loss absorbing 
capital, our total capital2 is approximately 
$500 billion vs. true risk-weighted assets 
of $1.1 trillion.3 Essentially, since 2008, our 
total capital has gone from $387 billion 
to $500 billion, while actual risk-weighted 
assets have declined to $1.1 trillion. 
In addition to our fortress balance sheet,  
we are well-diversified, and we have healthy 
margins and strong controls. These are all 
factors that dramatically improve safety 
and soundness, but they are not included in 
any measures. As you will see below, we can 
handle almost any stress.
We believe in stress testing, but it could be 
improved and simplified.
As you know, the Fed puts our company 
through one “severely adverse” stress test 
annually, which determines how we can use 
our capital, pay dividends, buy back stock and 
expand. We are great believers in stress testing 
but would like to make the following points:
•� Our shareholders should know that we 
don’t rely on one stress test a year – we 
conduct more than 200 each week across all 
of our riskiest exposures. We meet weekly; 
we analyze each exposure in multiple ways; 
we are extremely risk conscious.
•� The Federal Reserve’s Comprehensive 
Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) 
stress test estimates what our losses 
would be through a severely adverse 
event lasting over nine quarters, which 
approximates the severity and time of 
the Great Recession; e.g., high unem-
ployment, counterparty failures, etc. The 
Fed estimates that in such a scenario, we 
would lose $31 billion over the ensuing 
nine quarters, which is easily manageable 
by JPMorgan Chase’s capital base. My 
own view is that we would make money 
in almost every quarter in that type of 
environment, and this is supported by 
our having earned approximately $30 
billion pre-tax over the course of the nine 
quarters during the real financial crisis. 
22
22
II.  RegulatoRy RefoRm
We don’t completely understand the Fed’s 
assumptions and models – the Fed does not 
share them with us (we hope there will be 
more transparency and clarity in the future). 
But we do understand that the Fed’s stress 
test shows results far worse than our own 
test because the Fed’s stress test is not a fore-
cast of what you actually think will happen.  
Instead, it appropriately makes additional 
assumptions about a company’s likelihood 
to fail – that its trading losses will be far 
worse than expected, etc. The Fed wants to 
make sure the bank has enough capital if just 
about everything goes wrong.
Finally, while we firmly believe banks should 
have a proper assessment of their qualitative 
abilities, this should not be part of a once-a-
year stress test. Instead, it should be part of 
the Fed’s regular exam process. The Fed and 
the banks should work together to continu-
ously improve the quality of their processes 
while creating a consistent, safe and econ-
omy-growing use of capital.
It is clear that the banks have too much capital.
Here is another critical point: The Fed’s stress 
test of the 33 major banks estimates what 
each bank would lose assuming it were the 
worst bank in the crisis, which, of course, will 
not be true in the real world. But even if that 
happened, the chart below shows that if you 
combine all the banks’ extreme losses, the total 
losses add up to less than 10% of the banks’ 
combined capital. This definitively proves that 
there is excess capital in the system.
And more of that capital can be safely used to 
finance the economy.
Proper calibration of capital is critical to 
ensure not only that the system is safe and 
sound but that banks can use their capital to 
finance the economy. And we think it’s clear 
that banks can use more of their capital to 
finance the economy without sacrificing safety 
and soundness. Had they been less afraid of 
potential CCAR stress losses, banks probably 
would have been more aggressive in making 
some small business loans, lower rated middle 
market loans and near-prime mortgages.

The global systemically important bank (GSIB) 
and supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) rules 
need to be modified. 
The GSIB capital surcharge forces large banks 
to add even more capital, based on some 
very complex calculations that are highly 
flawed and not risk based. In fact, the rules 
often penalize fairly risk-free activity, such as 
deposits held at the Fed and short-term secured 
financing. Likewise, the SLR rules force capital 
to be held on deposit at the Fed in Treasury 
securities and in other liquid securities. Neither 
calculation gives credit for operating margins, 
diversification or annuity streams of business. 
These calculations should, at a minimum, 
be significantly modified and balanced to 
promote lending and other policy goals, 
including maintaining deep and liquid capital 
markets, clearing derivatives and directing 
more private capital in the mortgage market.
Operational risk capital should be significantly 
modified, if not eliminated.
No one could credibly argue that there is no 
such thing as operational risk, separate and 
distinct from credit and market risk. All busi-
nesses have operational risk (trucks crash, 
computers fail, lawsuits happen, etc.), but 
almost all businesses successfully manage it 
through their operating earnings and general 
resources. Basel standards required banks 
to hold capital for operational risk, and the 
United States “gold plated” this calculation. 
Banks in the United States in total now hold 
approximately $200 billion in operational risk 
capital. For us, we hold excess operational risk 
capital which is not being utilized to support 
our economy. It was an unnecessarily large 
add-on. If you are going to have operational 
risk capital, it should be forward looking, fairly 
calculated, coordinated with other capital rules 
and consistent with reality. (Currently, if you 
exit a business that created operational risk 
capital, you are still, most likely, required to 
hold the operational risk capital.) 
Finally, America should eliminate its “gold 
plating” of international standards. 
American regulators took the new Basel 
standards across a wide variety of calcula-
tions and asked for more. If JPMorgan Chase 
could use the same international standards 
as other international banks, it would free up 
a material amount of capital. The removal of 
the GSIB surcharge “gold plating” alone would 
free up $15 billion of equity capital – an 
amount that could support almost $190 billion 
of loans. In addition, America gold plated 
operational risk capital, liquidity rules, SLR 
rules and TLAC rules. Later in this letter, we 
will discuss international standards. 
Properly done and improved, modifying 
many of these regulatory standards could 
help finance the growth of the American 
economy without damaging the safety and 
soundness of the system.
3. How do certain regulatory policies impact money markets? 
Different from most banks, money center 
banks help large institutions – including 
governments, investors and large money 
market funds – move short-term funds 
around the system to where those funds are 
needed most. The recipients of these funds 
include financial institutions (including non-
money center banks) and corporations that 
can have large daily needs to invest or borrow. 
The products that money center banks offer 
large institutions are predominantly deposits, 
securities, money market funds and short-
term overnight investments called repurchase 
agreements. These involve enormous flows 
of funds, which money center banks handle 
easily, carefully and securely. They are gener-
ally match-funded4, almost no credit risk is 
taken, and most lending is done wholly and 
properly secured by Treasuries or govern-
ment-guaranteed securities. These transac-
tions represent a large part of JPMorgan 
Chase’s balance sheet. Because of new rules, 
capital in many cases must be held on these 
short-term, virtually riskless activities, and 
we believe this has caused distortions in the 
marketplace. For example:
4Match-funding ensures that 
the risk characteristics — 
e.g., interest rate, maturity 
— of the asset (e.g., loan)  
are offset by the liability 
(e.g., deposit) funding it.

•� Swap spreads, for the first time in history, 
turned negative, which means that corpo-
rations need to pay a lot more to hedge 
their interest rate exposure.
•� Reduction in broker-dealer inventories has 
impacted liquidity.
•� Many banks reject certain types of large 
deposits from some of their large institu-
tional clients. In a peculiar twist of fate 
– and something difficult for our clients 
to understand – through 2016, JPMorgan 
Chase turned away 3,200 large clients 
and $200 billion of their deposits even 
though we could have taken them without 
incurring any risk whatsoever (we simply 
would have deposited the $200 billion at 
the central bank).
The charts below shows some of the reduc-
tion in banks’ market-making abilities.
We need to work closely with regulators to 
assess the impact of the new rules on specific 
markets, the cost and volatility of liquidity, 
and the potential cost of credit. We should 
be able to make some modest changes that 
in no way impact safety and soundness but 
improve markets. 
4. How has regulation affected monetary policy, the flow of bank credit and the growth of the 
economy? 
It is extremely important that we analyze 
how new capital and liquidity rules affect the 
creation of credit; i.e., lending. We have yet 
to see thorough, thoughtful analysis on this 
subject by economists – because in this case, 
it is very hard to calculate what might have 
been counterfactual. However, it seems clear 
that if banks had been able to use more of 
their capital and liquidity, they would have 
been more aggressive in terms of expanding: 
Think of additional bankers, bank branches 
and geographies, which likely would have 
led to additional lending. (On the following 
pages, we make it clear that this would have 
been the case in mortgage lending.) 
I would like to focus on how liquidity policies 
may have impacted the effectiveness of mone-
tary policy and lending. The chart on page 
25 shows bank loans vs. bank deposits from 
2006 to 2016. During the last several decades, 
deposits and loans were mostly balanced. 
You can see that stopped being true after the 
start of the Great Recession. Today, loans are 
approximately $2 trillion less than deposits.

Many factors may influence this scenario, 
but there are two arguments at the bookends 
about why this happened:
•� There was simply not enough loan 
demand due to a slow-growing economy.
•� The new liquidity rules require banks 
to hold approximately $2 trillion at the 
Federal Reserve, whether or not there is 
loan demand.
It is evident that banks reduced certain types 
of lending legitimately – think of some of the 
inappropriate subprime mortgage lending – 
but banks cut back on other types of lending 
as well because of the new rules; for example, 
small business lending due to CCAR and 
cross-border lending because of GSIB. The 
ensuing discussion shows how other regula-
tory rules dramatically decreased mortgage 
lending, again slowing down the economy. 
It is clear that the transmission of monetary 
policy is different today from what it was in 
the past because of new capital and liquidity 
rules. What is not clear is how much these 
rules reduced lending. Again, working 
together, we should be able to figure it out and 
make appropriate improvements that enhance 
economic growth without damaging the safety 
of the system.
5. How can we reform mortgage markets to give qualified borrowers access to the credit they need? 
Much of what we consider good in America 
– a good job, stability and community 
involvement – is represented in the achieve-
ment of homeownership. Owning a home is 
still the embodiment of the American Dream, 
and it is commonly the most important asset 
that most families have.
So it is no surprise the financial crisis, which 
was caused in part by poor mortgage lending 
practices and which caused so much pain 
for American families and businesses, led 
to new regulations and enhanced supervi-
sion. We needed to create a safer and better 
functioning mortgage industry. However, our

housing sector has been unusually slow to 
recover, and that may be partly due to restric-
tions in mortgage credit.
Seven major federal regulators and a long list 
of state and local regulators have overlapping 
jurisdiction on mortgage laws and wrote a 
plethora of new rules and regulations appro-
priately focused on educating and protecting 
customers. While some of the rules are 
beneficial, many were hastily developed and 
layered upon existing rules without coordina-
tion or calibration as to the potential effects. 
The result is a complex, highly risky and 
unpredictable operating environment that 
exposes lenders and servicers to dispropor-
tionate legal liability and materially increases 
operational risks and costs. These actions 
resulted in:
•� Mortgages that cost the consumer more
•� A tightening credit box; i.e., mortgage 
lenders are less likely to extend credit to 
borrowers without a strong credit history 
•� An inhibition of the return of private 
capital to the housing industry
•� The crowding out of resources to improve 
technology and the customer experience

There are significant opportunities to make 
simple changes that can have a dramatic 
impact on improving the current state of the 
home lending industry – this will make access 
to good and affordable mortgages much more 
achievable for far more Americans. And it’s 
noteworthy that those who lost access to 
mortgage credit are the very ones who so 
many people profess to want to help – e.g., 
lower income buyers, first-time homebuyers, 
the self-employed and individuals with prior 
defaults who deserve another chance.
Federal Housing Administration (FHA) reform can 
bring banks back and expand access to credit. 
The FHA plays a significant role in providing 
credit for first-time, low- to moderate-income 
and minority homebuyers. However, aggres-
sive use of the False Claims Act (FCA) (a 
Civil War act passed to protect the govern-
ment from intentional fraud) and overly 
complex regulations have made FHA lending 
risky and cost prohibitive for many banks. 
In fact, FCA settlements wiped out a decade 
of FHA profitability, and subsequent losses

have kept returns on capital solidly below 
our target. This has led us to scale back our 
participation in the FHA lending program in 
favor of less burdensome lending programs 
that serve the same consumer base – and we 
are not alone. The chart above shows that 
nonbanks have gone from 20% to 80% of 
FHA originations.
A first step to increasing participation in the 
FHA program could be the communication of 
support for only using the FCA, as originally 
intended, to penalize intentional fraud rather 
than immaterial or unintentional errors. Other 
changes that would help would be:
•� Improve and fully implement the 
Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) 
proposed defect taxonomy, clarifying 
liability for fraudulent activity.
•� Revise certification requirements to make 
them more commercially reasonable.
•� Simplify loss mitigation by allowing 
streamlined programs and aligning with 
industry standards.
•� Eliminate costly, unnecessary and 
outdated requirements that make the cost 
of servicing an FHA loan significantly 
more expensive than a conventional loan.
Mortgage servicing is too complex: National 
servicing standards would help.
Mortgage servicing is a particularly complex 
business in which the cumulative impact 
of regulations has dramatically increased 
operational and compliance risk and costs 
(remember that costs are usually passed 
on to the customer). Mortgage servicing 
starts immediately after loan origination 
(loan origination also has become signifi-
cantly more expensive and complex as a 
result of regulatory changes) and involves a 
continuing and dynamic relationship among 
a servicer, customer and investor or guar-
antor, such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or 
FHA, to name a few. 
New mortgage rules and regulations total 
more than 14,000 pages and stand about six 
feet tall. In servicing alone, there are thou-
sands of pages of federal and state servicing 
rules now – clearly driving up complexity 
and cost. The Mortgage Bankers Associa-
tion estimated the fully loaded annual cost 
of industry servicing, as of 2015, to be $181 
for a performing mortgage and $2,386 for a 
mortgage in default. The cost of servicing a 
defaulted loan is so high that many servicers 
avoid underwriting loans that have even a 
modest probability of default. This is another

reason why mortgage companies avoid under-
writing certain types of mortgages today than 
they would have underwritten in the past. 
The most promising opportunity in mort-
gage servicing is to adopt uniform national 
servicing standards across guarantors, 
federal and state regulators, and investors. 
Importantly, there is no need for legislation 
to implement the necessary coordination to 
get this done. In particular, the U.S. Treasury 
is well-positioned to lead key players in the 
mortgage industry (the Consumer Finan-
cial Protection Bureau, Fannie Mae, Freddie 
Mac, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, 
HUD, the FHA, the Veterans Administra-
tion, Ginnie Mae and the U.S. Department 
of Agriculture) to establish national service 
standards that would simplify mortgage 
origination and servicing. Treasury played a 
similarly pivotal leadership role during the 
crisis when it helped develop the various 
mortgage assistance initiatives, such as the 
loan modification and streamlined refinance 
programs that allowed many Americans to 
stay in their homes and communities. 
Private capital needs to return in order to make 
the market less taxpayer dependent — we need  
to complete the securitization standards.
Private capital in the mortgage industry, 
particularly in the form of securitizations, 
dried up as a result of the financial crisis. 
Eight years later, we still have not opened up 
a healthy securitization market because of 
our inability to finalize the rules. Not only 
does this reduce the share of private capital 
in the U.S. housing sector (an action that 
would significantly reduce taxpayer expo-
sure), it also significantly increases the cost 
to the customer. Taking a few actions would 
fix this, including: 
•� Rationalize capital requirements on securi-
tizations to effectively transfer risk to the 
market while leaving “skin in the game” 
with the originator.
•� Reduce the complexity of data delivery 
requirements.
•� Clarify and define materiality standards 
associated with compliance with laws and 
regulations, as well as underwriting stan-
dards, to allow for reasonable protections 
from litigation and to enable standardized 
due diligence practices. 
If we do this right, we believe the mortgage 
market could add more than $300 billion a year 
in new purchased loans.
If we take the actions mentioned above, we 
believe that the cost to a customer would 
be 20 basis points lower and that mortgage 
underwriters would be willing to take more 
– but appropriate – risk on loans (again, this 
would be for first-time, young and lower 
income buyers, those with prior delinquen-
cies but who are now in good financial 
standing and those who are self-employed). 
Taken in total, we believe the issues identi-
fied above have reduced mortgage lending by 
more than $300 billion purchased mortgages 
annually (our analysis deliberately excludes 
underwriting the subprime and Alt-A mort-
gages that caused so many problems in the 
Great Recession). Had we been able to fix 
these issues five years ago (i.e., three years 
after the crisis), our analysis shows that, 
conservatively, more than $1 trillion in mort-
gage loans might have been made. 
If this is true, it may explain why our housing 
sector has been unusually slow to recover: 
$1 trillion of new mortgage loans is approxi-
mately 3 million loans. Of these, typically 
more than 20% would go to purchase new 
homes that would need to be built. By any 
estimate, this could have had a significant 
impact on the growth of jobs and gross 
domestic product (GDP). Our economists think 
that $1 trillion of loans could have increased 
GDP, in each of those five years, by 0.5%. In 
the next section, we will talk about how this is 
just one of the many things we did to damage 
our nation’s economy.

6. How can we reduce complexity and create a more coherent regulatory system?
We created a massively complex system 
in which multiple regulators have overlap-
ping responsibilities on virtually every issue, 
including rulemaking, examination, auditing 
and enforcement. This is extremely taxing, 
complex and overly burdensome for banks, 
customers of banks and regulators. 
Dodd-Frank appropriately established the 
Financial Services Oversight Committee 
(FSOC) and assigned to it the responsibility 
of general oversight across the entire finan-
cial system. Unfortunately, the FSOC was 
not given the ability to adjudicate issues or 
assign responsibility. Therefore, the FSOC is 
unable to fully resolve some of the problems 
that we have detailed in this letter. Finally, 
another flaw is that some of the laws were 
written in a way that left them open to broad 
interpretation and novel enforcement. 
There is too much complexity in the system — it 
could be fixed, and that would make the system 
stronger.
Nearly everyone agrees there is too much 
complexity in the current construct of the 
financial system. A few examples will suffice:
•� There are multiple calculations of capital, 
living wills, the Volcker Rule, etc.
•� There are multiple regulators involved 
independently in rulemaking – just two 
examples: Seven regulators are involved 
in setting mortgage regulations, and five 
regulators oversee the Volcker Rule. This 
leads to slow rulemaking (e.g., as noted 
above, we still have not finished the mort-
gage rules eight years after the crisis), 
excessive reporting and varied interpreta-
tions on what the actual rules are.
•� Each agency makes separate audit and 
reporting demands and can indepen-
dently take enforcement action on the 
same subject.
This is clearly a dysfunctional structure.  
The fix is simple – though getting it done 
may not be:
•� The system should be simplified. There 
should be one primary regulator on any 
issue, and we should always strive to make 
things as simple as possible. 
•� The primary regulator should establish 
the rules, the reporting requirements, the 
audit plans and the enforcement action. 
Other regulators should get involved only 
if they believe the primary person did a 
particularly poor job.
•� Everything in the regulatory landscape 
should be reviewed in the context of 
safety and soundness, cost-benefit analysis 
and economic growth.
The FSOC is a good idea but needs to be modified 
to be more effective.
It makes sense for regulators to be continu-
ously reviewing the entire financial system 
in an effort to make it as safe and sound as 
possible (think of this as a well-functioning 
risk committee of a major bank). But the 
FSOC should be given some authority to 
assign responsibility, adjudicate disagree-
ments, set deadlines and force the reso-
lution of critical issues. The FSOC could 
also enforce due consideration of regula-
tions’ costs vs. benefits and the impact on 
economic growth. 
We have great sympathy for, and agree with, 
the complaints of the community banks. They 
are struggling to deal with the complexity 
and cost of meeting these requirements – 
and we agree these smaller banks should be 
relieved of many of the requirements. 
Enhancing the functionality of the FSOC and 
providing regulatory relief where appro-
priate should not be a political issue. The 
administration is currently conducting a 
review of the rules and regulations, which 
are burdensome and duplicative and which 
may impede economic growth. That process 
should be as de-politicized as possible. 
Everyone stands to gain when growth is 
enabled in a safe and sound manner.

II.  RegulatoRy RefoRm
7. How can we harmonize regulations across the globe? 
Currently, American regulators have been 
pushing the Basel Committee – the interna-
tional forum that is supposed to set inter-
national financial regulatory guidelines – to 
meet the even higher American standards 
around capital requirements, derivatives 
rules, risk-weight calculations, stress testing 
and other requirements. Many other coun-
tries around the world are telling Basel that 
it has gone too far and that it’s time to let 
the banks focus on healthy lending and 
growth of the economy. Following are a few 
principles that we think should guide global 
regulations and international coordination 
to increase safety and soundness and foster 
global growth:
•� International regulations should be 
coherent and generally harmonized 
around the world – but they don’t need to 
be exactly the same.
•� We should recognize where there are legit-
imate reasons to do something different. 
For example, certain types of loans legiti-
mately could draw different risk weighting 
in various countries based on historical 
performance, collateral and bankruptcy 
laws or even culture.
•� Cross-border financial rules need to be 
part of trade negotiations like any other 
product or service. We know we will be 
increasingly competing with Chinese 
banks, and, eventually, we need the U.S. 
government to make that part of our 
trade agreement.
•� We can acknowledge that the state of 
affairs in different countries, including 
in their banks and their economies, 
may differ and that these differences 
might warrant idiosyncratic regulatory 
responses. For example, European banks 
for eight years have consistently been put 
in the position of having to raise more 
and more capital and liquidity or having 
to reduce their lending capacity. While 
their capital standards may have been 
low compared with American standards 
(particularly in how they calculate risk-
weighted assets), this deleveraging has to 
have hurt the growth of European econo-
mies and opportunities for their people. 
These banks started from a different posi-
tion (which had been sanctioned by both 
their regulators and governments years 
ago), and we agree that these banks should 
be allowed to do their job. Most of these 
banks have plenty of total capital. While 
it might be true that one day they should 
have more, the moral imperative now is to 
help their economies grow and to help the 
people of those countries.
We are completely convinced that if we can 
rationally change and coordinate many of 
these rules, banks can do even more to help 
the economy thrive.

Before we address some of the critical issues confronting our country, it would be good to 
count our blessings. Let’s start with a serious assessment of our strengths. 
III.
America today is probably stronger than ever 
before. For example: 
•� The United States has the world’s stron-
gest military, and this will be the case for 
decades. We are fortunate to be at peace 
with our neighbors and to have the protec-
tion of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
•� As a nation, we have essentially all the 
food, water and energy we need.
•� The United States has among the world’s 
best universities and hospitals.
•� The United States has a generally reliable 
rule of law and low corruption. 
•� The government of the United States is the 
world’s longest surviving democracy, which 
has been steadfast, resilient and enduring 
through some very difficult times.
•� The people of the United States have a 
great work ethic and can-do attitude. 
•� Americans are among the most entrepre-
neurial and innovative people in the world 
– from those who work on the factory

2. But it is clear that something is wrong — and it’s holding us back. 
Our economy has been growing much more 
slowly in the last decade or two than in the 
50 years before then. From 1948 to 2000, 
real per capita GDP grew 2.3%; from 2000 
to 2016, it grew 1%. Had it grown at 2.3% 
instead of 1% in those 17 years, our GDP per 
capita would be 24%, or more than $12,500 
per person higher than it is. U.S. productivity 
growth tells much the same story, as shown 
in the chart on page 33. 
Our nation’s lower growth has been accom-
panied by – and may be one of the reasons 
why – real median household incomes in 
2015 were actually 2.5% lower than they 
were in 1999. In addition, the percentage of 
middle class households has actually shrunk 
over time. In 1971, 61% of households were 
considered middle class, but that percentage 
was only 50% in 2015. And for those in 
the bottom 20% of earners – mainly lower 
skilled workers – the story may be even 
1. The United States of America is truly an exceptional country.
floors to geniuses like the late Steve 
Jobs. Improving “things” and increasing 
productivity are American pastimes. And 
America still fosters an entrepreneurial 
culture, which allows risk taking – and 
acknowledges that it can result in success 
or failure. 
•� The United States is home to many of 
the best, most vibrant businesses on the 
planet – from small and midsized compa-
nies to large, global multinationals. 
•� The United States has the widest, deepest, 
most transparent and best financial 
markets in the world. And I’m not talking 
about just Wall Street and banks – I 
include the whole mosaic: venture capital, 
private equity, asset managers, individual 
and corporate investors, and public and 
private capital markets. Our financial 
markets have been an essential part of the 
great American business machine.
Very few countries, if any, are as blessed as 
we are.

worse. For this group, real incomes declined 
by more than 8% between 1999 and 2015. 
In 1984, 60% of families could afford a 
modestly priced home. By 2009, that figure 
fell to about 50%. This drop occurred even 
though the percentage of U.S. citizens with a 
high school degree or higher increased from 
30% to 50% from 1980 to 2013. Low-skilled 
labor just doesn’t earn what it used to, which 
understandably is a source of real frustration 
for a very meaningful group of people. The 
income gap between lower skilled and skilled 
workers has been growing and may be the 
inevitable consequence of an increasingly 
sophisticated economy.
Regarding reduced social mobility, 
researchers have found that the likelihood 
of workers moving to the top-earning decile 
from starting positions in the middle of the 
earnings distribution has declined by approx-
imately 20% since the early 1980s. 
Many economists believe we are now permanently 
relegated to slower growth and lower productivity 
(they say that secular stagnation is the new 
normal), but I strongly disagree. 
We will describe in the rest of this section 
many factors that are rarely considered in 
economic models although they can have an 
enormous effect on growth and productivity. 
Making this list was an upsetting exercise, 
especially since many of our problems have 
been self-inflicted. That said, it was also a 
good reminder of how much of this is in our 
control and how critical it is that we focus 
on all the levers that could be pulled to help 
the U.S. economy. We must do this because it 
will help all Americans.
Many other, often non-economic, factors impact 
growth and productivity.
Following is a list of some non-economic 
items that must have had a significant 
impact on America’s growth:
•� Over the last 16 years, we have spent tril-
lions of dollars on wars when we could 
have been investing that money produc-
tively. (I’m not saying that money didn’t 
need to be spent; but every dollar spent 
on battle is a dollar that can’t be put to 
use elsewhere.) 
•� Since 2010, when the government took 
over student lending, direct government 
lending to students has gone from approx-
imately $200 billion to more than $900 
billion – creating dramatically increased 
student defaults and a population that is 
rightfully angry about how much money 
they owe, particularly since it reduces 
their ability to get other credit.

•� Our nation’s healthcare costs are essen-
tially twice as much per person vs. most 
other developed nations.
•� It is alarming that approximately 40% 
(this is an astounding 300,000 students 
each year) of those who receive advanced 
degrees in science, technology, engi-
neering and math at American universi-
ties are foreign nationals with no legal 
way of staying here even when many 
would choose to do so. We are forcing 
great talent overseas by not allowing these 
young people to build their dreams here.
•� Felony convictions for even minor 
offenses have led, in part, to 20 million 
American citizens having a criminal 
record – and this means they often have 
a hard time getting a job. (There are six 
times more felons in the United States 
than in Canada.)  
•� The inability to reform mortgage markets 
has dramatically reduced mortgage avail-
ability. We estimate that mortgages alone 
would have been more than $1 trillion 
higher had we had healthier mortgage 
markets. Greater mortgage access would 
have led to more homebuilding and addi-
tional jobs and investments, which also 
would have driven additional growth. 
Any one of these non-economic factors is 
fairly material in damaging America’s effort 
to achieve healthy growth. Let’s dig a little bit 
deeper into six additional unsettling issues 
that have also limited our growth rate. 
Labor force participation is too low.
Labor force participation in the United 
States has gone from 66% to 63% between 
2008 and today. Some of the reasons for this 
decline are understandable and aren’t too 
worrisome – for example, an aging popula-
tion. But if you examine the data more closely 
and focus just on labor force participation for 
one key segment; i.e., men ages 25-54, you’ll 
see that we have a serious problem. The chart 
below shows that in America, the participa-
tion rate for that cohort has gone from 96% 
in 1968 to a little over 88% today. This is way 
below labor force participation in almost 
every other developed nation.

If the work participation rate for this group 
went back to just 93% – the current average 
for the other developed nations – approxi-
mately 10 million more people would be 
working in the United States. Some other 
highly disturbing facts include: Fifty-seven 
percent of these non-working males are on 
disability, and fully 71% of today’s youth 
(ages 17–24) are ineligible for the military 
due to a lack of proper education (basic 
reading or writing skills) or health issues 
(often obesity or diabetes).
Education is leaving too many behind.
Many high schools and vocational schools 
do not provide the education our students 
need – the goal should be to graduate and 
get a decent job. We should be ringing the 
national alarm bell that inner city schools are 
failing our children – often minorities and 
children from lower income households. In 
many inner city schools, fewer than 60% of 
students graduate, and many of those who 
do graduate are not prepared for employ-
ment. We are creating generations of citizens 
who will never have a chance in this land of 
dreams and opportunity. Unfortunately, it’s 
self-perpetuating, and we all pay the price.  
The subpar academic outcomes of America’s 
minority and low-income children resulted 
in yearly GDP losses of trillions of dollars, 
according to McKinsey & Company.
Infrastructure needs planning and investment.
In the early 1960s, America was considered 
by most to have the best infrastructure 
(highways, ports, water supply, electrical 
grid, airports, tunnels, etc.). The World 
Economic Forum now ranks the United 
States #27 on its Basic Requirements index, 
reflecting infrastructure along with other 
criteria, among 138 countries. On infrastruc-
ture, the United States is behind most major 
developed countries, including the United 
Kingdom, France and Korea. The American 
Society of Civil Engineers releases a report 
every four years examining current infra-
structure conditions and needs – the 2017 
report card gave us a grade of D+. Another 
interesting and distressing fact: The United 
States has not built a major airport in more 
than 20 years. China, on the other hand, has 
built 75 new civilian airports in the last 10 
years alone.
Our corporate tax system is driving capital and 
brains overseas.
America now has the highest corporate tax 
rates among developed nations. Most other 
developed nations have reduced their tax 
rates substantially over the past 10 years 
(and this is true whether looking at statu-
tory or effective tax rates). This is causing 
considerable damage. American corpora-
tions are generally better off investing 
their capital overseas, where they can earn 
a higher return because of lower taxes. In 
addition, foreign companies are advantaged 
when they buy American companies – often 
they are able to reduce the overall tax rate 
of the combined company. Because of this, 
American companies have been making 
substantial investments in human capital, 
as well as in plants, facilities, research 
and development (R&D) and acquisitions 
overseas. Also, American corporations hold 
more than $2 trillion in cash abroad to 
avoid the additional taxes. The only ques-
tion is how much damage will be done 
before we fix this. 
Reducing corporate taxes would incent busi-
ness investment and job creation. The charts 
on page 36 show the following:
•� That job growth is highly correlated to 
business investment (this also makes 
intuitive sense).
•� That fixed investments by businesses 
and capital formation have gone down 
substantially and are far below what we 
would consider normal.

And counterintuitively, reducing corporate 
taxes would also improve wages. One of the 
unintended consequences of high corporate 
taxes is that they actually depress wages in 
the United States. A 2007 Treasury Depart-
ment review finds that labor “may bear a 
substantial portion of the burden from the 
corporate income tax.” A study by Kevin 
Hassett from the American Enterprise 
Institute finds that each $1 increase in U.S. 
corporate income tax collections leads to a $2 
decrease in wages in the short run and a $4 
decrease in aggregate wages in the long run. 
And analysis of the U.S. corporate income tax 
by the Congressional Budget Office finds that 
labor bears more than 70% of the burden of 
the corporate income tax, with the remaining 
30% borne by domestic savers through a 
reduced return on their savings. We must fix 
this for the benefit of American competitive-
ness and all Americans.
Excessive regulations reduce growth and business 
formation. 
Everyone agrees we should have proper regu-
lation – and, of course, good regulations have 
many positive effects. But anyone in business 
understands the damaging effects of over-
complicated and inefficient regulations. There 
are many ways to look at regulations, and the 
chart below and the two on page 38 provide 
some insight. The one below shows the total 
pages of federal regulations, which is a simple 
way to illustrate additional reporting and 
compliance requirements. The second records 
how we compare with the rest of the world on 
the ease of starting a new business – we used 
to be among the best, and now we are not. 
The bottom chart on page 38 shows that small 
businesses now report that one of their largest 
problems is regulations. 
By some estimates, approximately $2 tril-
lion is spent on regulations annually (which 
is approximately $15,000 per U.S. household 
annually).5 And even if this number is exag-

gerated, it highlights a disturbing problem. 
Particularly troubling is that this may be one 
of the reasons why small business creation 
has slowed alarmingly in recent years. 
According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, 
the rising burdens of federal regulations alone 
may be a main reason for a falling pace in 
new business formation. In 1980, Americans 
were creating some 450,000 new companies a 
year. In 2013, they formed 400,000 new busi-
nesses despite a 40% increase in population 
from 1980 to 2013. Our three-decade slump 
in company formation fell to its lowest point 
with the onset of the Great Recession; even 
with more businesses being established today, 
America’s startup activity remains below pre-
recession levels.

While some regulations quite clearly create 
a common good (e.g., clean air and water), 
it is clear that excessive regulation does not 
help productivity, growth of the economy  
or job creation. And even regulations that  
once may have made sense may no longer 
be fit for the purpose. I am not going to 
outline specific recommendations about 
non-financial regulatory reform here, other 
than to say that we should have a perma-
nent and systematic review of the costs 
and benefits of regulations, including their 
intended vs. unintended consequences. 
The lack of economic growth and opportunity 
has led to deep and understandable frustration 
among so many Americans. 
Low job growth, a lack of opportunity for 
many, declining wages, students and low-
wage workers being left behind, economic 
and job uncertainty, high healthcare costs 
and growing income inequality all have 
created deep frustration. It is understand-
able why so many are angry at the leaders of 
America’s institutions, including businesses, 
schools and governments – they are right to 
expect us to do a better job. Collectively, we 
are the ones responsible. Additionally, this 
can understandably lead to disenchantment 
with trade, globalization and even our free 
enterprise system, which for so many people 
seems not to have worked. 
Our problems are significant, and they are 
not the singular purview of either political 
party. We need coherent, consistent, compre-
hensive and coordinated policies that help fix 
these problems. The solutions are not binary 
– they are not either/or, and they are not 
about Democrats or Republicans. They are 
about facts, analysis, ideas and best practices 
(including what we can learn from others 
around the world).
We need to work together to improve work skills.
I cannot in this letter tackle the complex set 
of issues confronting our inner city schools, 
but I do know that if we don’t acknowledge 
these problems, we will never fix them. 
Whether they graduate from high school, 
vocational or training school or go on to 
college, our students can and should be 
adequately prepared for good, decent-paying 
jobs. And whether a student graduates from 
high school, vocational school or training 
school, the graduate should have a sense of 
pride and accomplishment – and meaningful 
employment opportunities, without forgoing 
the chance to go to college later on. Career 
and technical education specifically can give 
young people the skills they need for decent-
paying roles in hundreds of fields, including 
aviation, robotics, medical science, welding, 
accounting and coding – all jobs that are in 
demand today. 
In New York City, not far from where I grew 
up in Jackson Heights, Queens, there’s a 
school called Aviation High School. Students 
travel from all over the city to go to the school 
(with a 97% student attendance rate), where 
they are trained in many facets of aviation, 
from how to maintain an aircraft to the 
details of the plane’s electronics, hydraulics 
and electrical systems. And when the students 
graduate (93% graduated in the normal four 
years), they get a job, often earning an annual 
starting salary of approximately $60,000. 
It’s a great example of what we should be 
promoting in our educational system. 
Businesses must be involved in this process. 
They need to partner with schools to let 
them know what skills are needed, help 
develop the appropriate curricula, help 
train teachers and be prepared to hire the 
students. In addition, this has to be done 
locally because that is where the actual jobs 
are. Germany does this well. Germany has

one of the strongest education and training 
systems in the world, with about 1.5 million 
young people every year participating in 
apprenticeship programs that are paid oppor-
tunities to gain in-demand skills along with 
an education. The vocational schools and 
apprenticeship programs work directly with 
local businesses to ensure the students are 
connected to available jobs upon graduation. 
As a result of this market-driven vocational 
training, Germany’s youth unemployment 
rate is also one of the lowest in the world. 
There is nothing wrong with learning from 
other countries. 
Proper skills training also can be used to 
continuously re-educate American workers. 
Many people are afraid that automation is 
taking away jobs. Let’s be clear. Technology 
is the best thing that ever happened to 
mankind, and it is the reason the world is 
getting progressively better. But we should 
acknowledge that though technology helps 
everyone generally, it does cause some job 
loss, dislocation and disruption in specific 
areas. Retraining is the best way to help those 
disrupted by advancements in technology.
We need to help lower skilled workers earn a 
living wage while helping small businesses. 
Business should support an expanded EITC.
There is a tax credit in the United States 
called the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), 
which supplements low-paid workers’ 
incomes. For example, a single mother with 
two children earning $9 an hour (approxi-
mately $20,000 a year) could get a tax credit 
of more than $5,000 at the end of the year. 
A single man without children could get a 
tax credit under this program of only about 
$500. This program has flaws (which we 
believe could be fixed), but it has lifted an 
estimated 9 million people above the poverty 
line. (The federal poverty guideline is deter-
mined by household size. For a four-person 
household, the poverty level is $24,600 or 
approximately $11 an hour.) Last year, the 
EITC program cost the United States about 
$67 billion, and there were 27 million indi-
viduals who received the credit. 
Approximately 20.6 million American 
workers earn between $7.25 an hour (the 
prevailing federal minimum wage) and 
$10.10 an hour. Approximately 42% of Amer-
ican workers make less than $15 an hour. I 
believe we should dramatically expand the 
EITC to help more low-paid individuals, with 
and without children, earn a living wage. 
I have no doubt that this will entice more 
workers back into the workforce. Jobs bring 
dignity. That first job is often the first rung 
on the ladder. And studies show that once 
people start working, they continue working. 
In addition, living wages lead to less crime, 
more household formation and, it is hoped, 
better social outcomes, including more 
marriages and children and better health and 
overall well-being. 
It is important to note that large companies 
generally pay well above the minimum wage 
and provide health insurance and retire-
ment benefits to all their employees. They 
also extensively train their employees and 
help them move along in their careers. While 
this would help small businesses far more 
than big businesses, large companies should 
support the expansion of this program 
because it would foster growth and be great 
for lower paid American workers. 
4. What should our country be doing to invest in its infrastructure? How does the lack of a plan  
and investment hurt our economy?
Infrastructure in America is a very broad and 
complex subject. However, we do have a few 
suggestions on how to make it better.
Similar to companies planning for capacity 
needs, it is quite clear that cities, states and 
the federal government can also plan around 
their somewhat predictable needs for main-
tenance, new roads and bridges, increasing 
electrical requirements and other necessities 
to serve a growing population. Infrastruc-
ture should not be a stop-start process but an 
ongoing endeavor whereby intelligent invest-
41
41
III. PUBLIC POLICY
ments are made continuously. And the plan 
could also be sped up if necessary to help a 
weakening economy.
Infrastructure, which could have a life of 
five to 50 years, should not be expensed as 
a government debt but should be accounted 
for as an investment that could be financed 
separately. Borrowing money for consump-
tion is completely different from borrowing 
for something that has value for a long 
period of time. 
It’s important to streamline the approval 
process, and approvals should run simultane-
ously and not sequentially. 
Last, we need to assure that we have good 
infrastructure and not bridges to nowhere. 
Good infrastructure serving real needs is not 
only conducive to jobs in the short run but 
to growth in the long run. Projects should be 
specifically identified, with budgets and calen-
dars and with responsible parties named. 
5. How should the U.S. legal and regulatory systems be reformed to incentivize investment  
and job creation?
There are many reasons to be proud of our 
system of government. The U.S. Constitution 
is the bedrock of the greatest democracy in 
the world. The checks and balances put in 
place by the framers are still powerful limits 
on each branch’s powers. And this year, we 
witnessed one of the hallmarks of our great 
nation – the peaceful transition of power 
following a democratic election.
Our legal system, including our nation’s 
commitment to the rule of law, has long 
been a particular source of strength for our 
economy. When people, communities and 
companies are confident in the stability and 
fairness of a country’s legal system, they want 
to do business in that country and invest 
there (and come from overseas to do so). 
Knowing that you will have access to courts 
for a fair and timely hearing on matters and 
that there are checks against abuses of power 
is important. As the discussion about areas 
for potential reform continues, it is critical 
that these long-term U.S. advantages are kept 
in mind and preserved. 
In regulation, for example, I worry that the 
distribution of power has shifted. Congress, 
through the Administrative Procedures Act 
(APA), set out how regulators should publish 
draft rules. The APA allows for comments 
on draft rules, including comments on how 
a proposed rule will impact lending, jobs 
and the economy. Today, however, agencies 
often regulate through supervisory guidance 
that isn’t subject to the same commentary or 
checks. The function of interpretive guid-
ance is to clarify or explain existing law and 
should not be used to impose new, substan-
tive requirements. Now is a good time to 
discuss how to reset this balance.
There also is an opportunity to have a similar 
conversation around enforcement and litiga-
tion. On the civil side, we should look closely 
at whether statutory damages provisions 
work as intended. I read recently about 
a settlement under the Fair and Accurate 
Credit Transactions Act in which plaintiffs 
received in excess of $30 million from a 
business that printed credit card receipts 
with the customer’s card expiration date. Is 
that fair and proportionate – or is the result 
driven by a statutory damages framework 
that should be reconsidered? 
And simply because the company agreed to 
the settlement does not mean it was the right 
result. Here is the fact: The current dynamics 
make it very hard for companies to get their 
day in court – as the consequences of a loss 
at trial can be disproportionately severe. This 
is particularly true in a government-initiated 
case. The collateral consequences of standing 
up to a regulator or losing at trial can be 
disproportionately negative when compared 
with the underlying issue or proposed settle-
ment, and it can lead to the decision not to 
fight at all, no matter what the merits of the 
case may be. The Institute for Legal Reform, 
for the Chamber of Commerce has framed 
this issue as follows:
42
42
III. PUBLIC POLICY
“The so-called ‘trial penalty’ has virtually 
annihilated the constitutional right to a trial. 
What are the consequences of a system in 
which the government is only rarely required 
to prove its case? What are the implications 
of this on businesses, both large and small? 
Ultimately, what are the long-term prospects 
for entrepreneurship in an environment 
where even the most minor, unintentional 
misstep may result in criminal investigation, 
prosecution and loss of liberty?”
When you combine this with the fact that 
businesses have no “penalty-free” way to 
challenge a new interpretation of the law, the 
net-net result is a system that fosters legislation 
by enforcement actions and settlements. Said 
differently, rather than Congress expanding a 
law or a court testing a novel interpretation, 
regulators and prosecutors make those deci-
sions and companies acquiesce. 
The impact of these issues is further exacer-
bated by a system that allows for “multiple 
jeopardy,” where federal, state, prudential 
and foreign agencies can “pile on” to any 
matter, each seeking its own penalty without 
any mechanism to ensure that the multiple 
punishments are proportionate and fair. It 
would be like getting pulled over by a local 
police officer and getting fined by your local 
town, then by your county, then by your 
state, then by the federal government and 
then having the U.N. weigh in since the car 
was made overseas.
To be clear, we need regulators focused on 
the safety and soundness of all institutions. 
We need enforcement bodies focused on 
compliance with the law. But we also need to 
preserve the system of checks and balances 
– when you cannot get your day in court on 
some really important issues, we all suffer. 
We need to improve and reform our legal 
system because it is having a chilling 
impact on business formation, risk taking 
and entrepreneurship. 
6. What price are we paying for the lack of understanding about business and free enterprise?
The United States needs to ensure that we 
maintain a healthy and vibrant economy. 
This is what fuels job creation, raises the 
standard of living for those who are hurting, 
and positions us to invest in education, 
technology and infrastructure in a program-
matic and sustainable way to build a better 
and safer future for our country and its 
people. America’s military will be the best in 
the world only as long as we have the best 
economy in the world. 
Business plays a critical role as an engine of 
economic growth, particularly our largest, 
globally competitive American businesses. 
As an example, the thousand largest compa-
nies in America (out of approximately 29 
million) employ nearly 30 million people 
in the United States, and almost all of their 
employees get full medical and retirement 
benefits and extensive training. In addition, 
these companies account for more than 30% 
of the roughly $2.3 trillion spent annually 
on capital expenditures. Capital expendi-
tures and R&D spending drive productivity 
and innovation, which ultimately drive job 
creation across the entire economy. 
To support this, we need a pro-growth policy 
environment from the government that 
provides a degree of certainty around long-
standing issues that have proved frustrat-
ingly elusive to solve. The most pressing 
areas in which government, business and 
other stakeholders can find common ground 
should include tax reform, infrastructure 
investment, education reform, more favor-
able trade agreements and a sensible immi-
gration policy, among others.
When you read that small businesses and big 
businesses are pitted against each other or 
are not good for each other, don’t believe it.

Why are America’s public equity markets so important?  
How do we sustain them and strengthen corporate governance?
For more than two centuries, the American free enterprise 
system has led to enormous prosperity for our country: the 
creation of jobs, increases in wages and savings, and the 
emergence and growth of dynamic companies. Because well-
managed and well-governed businesses are the engines of our 
economy, good corporate governance must be more than just 
a catchphrase or fad. It’s an imperative — especially when it 
comes to our publicly owned companies.
The chart on the right should be a cause for concern. It notes 
that the number of public companies in the United States has 
declined 45% since 1996.
There may very well be some logical and good explanations for 
why this is so; e.g., companies can get capital more easily in the 
private markets, and the private markets can be more efficient 
than they used to be. 
I suspect there are other less-constructive reasons, which could 
be greatly expanded upon, but I will merely list them below:
• 
Excessive litigation, including shareholder class action 
lawsuits
•�
Excessive and expensive reporting requirements
• 
Self-serving shareholder activity and proposals not intended 
to benefit the company 
• 
Shareholder meetings that are hijacked by special interest 
groups and become a complete farce
• 
Too much short-termism; i.e., quarterly earnings, at the 
expense of making good, long-term investments
• 
Constant and frequent negative media scrutiny — some 
deserved and some not
• 
Boards spending more and more time on check-the-box 
legal and regulatory demands as opposed to the most 
important role of boards — management, strategy,  
major risks, etc.
Many private equity companies often stress that it is better to 
be owned by them because they operate with commonsense 
corporate governance; i.e., less check-the-box corporate 
governance — whether addressing board membership, how a 
board spends its time, management compensation or long-term 
results vs. just quarterly earnings. The following page exhibits a 
letter drafted by a diverse group of financial leaders that outlines 
recommendations for commonsense corporate governance 
principles that would foster the health of our public companies.
It is hard to estimate the cause and effect of all these factors, 
but they are reasons for concern. America’s public markets have 
been a key to America’s success, and I suspect that years from 
now, we may regret the damage we have done to them.

The health of America’s public corporations and financial markets — and public trust in both — is critical to economic growth and a better 
financial future for American workers, retirees and investors. 
Millions of American families depend on these companies for work — our nearly 5,000 public companies account for a third of the nation’s 
private sector jobs. And these same families and millions more also rely on public companies to help improve their financial future — they 
are heavily invested in these companies through mutual funds, 401(k) and pension plans, college savings plans and other accounts to buy a 
home, send their children to college and save for retirement.
Our future depends on these companies being managed effectively for long-term prosperity, which is why the governance of American companies 
is so important to every American. Corporate governance in recent years has often been an area of intense debate among investors, corporate 
leaders and other stakeholders. Yet, too often, that debate has generated more heat than light. 
We represent some of America’s largest corporations, as well as investment managers, that, as fiduciaries, represent millions of individual savers 
and pension beneficiaries. We include corporate CEOs, the head of the Canadian public pension fund and an activist investor, and the heads of a 
number of institutional investors who manage money on behalf of a broad range of Americans.
This diverse group certainly holds varied opinions on corporate governance. But we share the view that constructive dialogue requires find-
ing common ground — a starting point to foster the economic growth that benefits shareholders, employees and the economy as a whole. 
To that end, we have worked to find commonsense principles. We offer these principles, which can be found at www.governanceprinciples.
org, in the hope that they will promote further conversation on corporate governance. These principles include the following, among others:
■ Truly independent corporate boards are vital to effective governance, so no board should be beholden to the CEO or management. Every 
board should meet regularly without the CEO present, and every board should have active and direct engagement with executives below 
the CEO level;
■ Diverse boards make better decisions, so every board should have members with complementary and diverse skills, backgrounds and experi-
ences. It’s also important to balance wisdom and judgment that accompany experience and tenure with the need for fresh thinking and 
perspectives of new board members;
■ Every board needs a strong leader who is independent of management. The board’s independent directors usually are in the best posi-
tion to evaluate whether the roles of chairman and CEO should be separate or combined; and if the board decides on a combined role, 
it is essential that the board have a strong lead independent director with clearly defined authorities and responsibilities;
■ Our financial markets have become too obsessed with quarterly earnings forecasts. Companies should not feel obligated to provide earnings 
guidance — and should do so only if they believe that providing such guidance is beneficial to shareholders;
■ A common accounting standard is critical for corporate transparency, so while companies may use non-Generally Accepted Accounting 
Principles (“GAAP”) to explain and clarify their results, they never should do so in such a way as to obscure GAAP-reported results; and 
in particular, since stock- or options-based compensation is plainly a cost of doing business, it always should be reflected in non-GAAP 
measurements of earnings; and
■ Effective governance requires constructive engagement between a company and its shareholders. So the company’s institutional investors 
making decisions on proxy issues important to long-term value creation should have access to the company, its management and, in some 
circumstances, the board; similarly, a company, its management and board should have access to institutional investors’ ultimate decision 
makers on those issues.
These recommendations are not meant to be absolute. We know that there is significant variation among our public companies and that their 
approach to corporate governance will inevitably (and appropriately) reflect those differences. But we do hope our effort will be the beginning 
of a continuing dialogue that will benefit millions of Americans by promoting trust in our nation’s public companies. 
We encourage others to join in that dialogue. Our country, our economy and the future of our citizens depend on getting corporate governance right.

III. PUBLIC POLICY
Small businesses and large businesses are 
symbiotic – they are substantial customers of 
each other, and they help drive each other’s 
growth – and are integral to our large busi-
ness ecosystem. At JPMorgan Chase, for 
example, we support more than 4 million 
small business clients, 15,000 middle market 
companies, and approximately 7,000 corpo-
rations and investor clients. We also rely on 
services from nearly 30,000 vendors, many 
of which are small and midsized companies. 
Business, taken as a whole, is the source of 
almost all job creation. 
Approximately 150 million people work 
in the United States; 130 million work in 
private enterprise. We hold in high regard 
the 20 million people who work in govern-
ment – teachers, policemen, firemen and 
others. But we could not pay for those jobs 
if the other 130 million were not actively 
producing the GDP of America. 
Something has gone awry in the public’s 
understanding of business and free enter-
prise. Whether it is the current environ-
ment or the deficiency of education in 
general, the lack of understanding around 
free enterprise is astounding. When busi-
nesses or individuals in business do some-
thing wrong (problems that all institutions 
have, including schools, churches, govern-
ments, small businesses, etc.), they should 
be appropriately punished – but not demon-
ized. We need trust and confidence in our 
institutions – confidence is the “secret sauce” 
that, without spending any money, helps the 
economy grow. A strong and vibrant private 
sector (including big companies) is good for 
the average American. Entrepreneurship 
and free enterprise, with strong ethics and 
high standards, are worth rooting for, not 
attacking.
7. Strong collaboration is needed between 
business and government.
We all can agree that a general dissatisfaction 
with the lack of true collaboration and will-
ingness to address our most pressing policy 
issues has contributed to the existing divisive 
and polarized environment. Certainly there 
is plenty of blame to go around on this front. 
However, rather than looking back, it is 
now more important than ever for the busi-
ness community and government to come 
together and collaborate to find meaningful 
solutions and develop thoughtful policies 
that create economic growth and opportunity 
for all. This cannot be done by government 
alone or by business alone. We all must work 
together in ways that put aside our “business-
as-usual” approaches. The lack of economic 
opportunity is a moral and economic crisis 
that affects everyone. There are too many 
people who are not getting a fair chance to 
get ahead and move up the economic ladder. 
This runs contrary to the fundamental idea 
that America is a country where everyone 
has an opportunity to improve their lives 
and that future generations of Americans 
know they can be just as successful as those 
who came before them. 
By working together and applying some 
good old American can-do ingenuity, there is 
nothing that we can’t accomplish. By working 
together, the business community, govern-
ment and the nonprofit sector can ensure 
and maintain a healthy and vibrant economy 
today and into the future, creating jobs, 
fostering economic mobility and maintaining 
sustainable economic growth. Ultimately, this 
translates to an improved quality of life and 
greater financial security for those who are 
struggling to make ends meet. It also would 
be a significant step in restoring public faith 
in two of our greatest democratic institutions 
– U.S. business and government – and would 
allow us to move forward toward a pros-
perous future for all Americans.

In closing, I can’t emphasize enough how honored I am to work at 
this company and with its people. What they have accomplished 
during these turbulent times has been extraordinary. On behalf of 
JPMorgan Chase and its management, I want to express my deepest 
gratitude to our people – I am proud to be their partner

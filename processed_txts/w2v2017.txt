jamie dimon chairman and chief executive officer dear fellow shareholders once again i begin this letter with a sense of pride about jpmorganchaseas i look back on last year — in fact the last decade — it is remarkable how well our company has performedand i’m not only talking about our strong financial performance — but also about how much we have accomplished to help our clients customers and communities all around the worldours is an exceptional company with an extraordinary heritage and a promising futurewe continue to make excellent progress around technology risk and controls innovation diversity and reduced bureaucracywe’ve helped communities large and small — by doing what we do best lending investing and serving our clients by creatively expanding certain flagship corporate responsibility programs including the entrepreneurs of color fund the fellowship initiative and our service corps and by applying our successful detroit investment model to neighborhood revitalization efforts in the bronx in new york city chicago and washington dcthroughout a period of profound political and economic change around the world our company has been steadfast in our

stockin prior years i explained why buying back our stock at tangible book value per share was a nobrainersix years ago we offered an example of this with earnings per share and tangible book value per share being substantially higher than they otherwise would have been just four years laterwhile we prefer buying back our stock at tangible book value we think it makes sense to do so even at or above two times tangible book value for reasons similar to those we’ve expressed in the pastif we buy back a big block of stock this year we would expect using analyst earnings estimates for the next five years earnings per share in five years to be  — higher and tangible book value to be virtually unchangedas you know we believe tangible book value per share is a good measure of the value we have created for our shareholdersif our asset and liability values are appropriate — and we believe they are — and if we can continue to deploy this capital profitably we now think that it can earn approximately  return on tangible equity for the foreseeable futurethen in our view our company should ultimately be worth considerably more than tangible book valuethe chart on the bottom of page

to use our capital to grow than to buy back stockbuying back stock should only be considered when we either cannot invest sometimes that’s a function of regulatory policies or when we are generating excess unusable capitalwe currently have excess capital but due to recent tax reform and a more constructive regulatory environment we hope in the future to use more of our excess capital to grow our businesses expand into new markets and support our employeesour stock price is a measure of the progress we have made over the yearsthis progress is a function of continually making important investments in good times and notsogood times to build our capabilities — people systems and productsthese investments drive the future prospects of our company and position it to grow and prosper for decadeswhether looking back over five years  years or since the bank onejpmorganchase merger approximately  years ago our stock has significantly outperformed the standard  poor’s  index sp  and the sp financials indexand this growth came during a time of unprecedented challenges for banks — both the great recession and the  extraordinarily difficult legal regulatory and political environment that followedwe have long contended that these factors explained why bank stock price earnings ratios were appropriately depressedand we believe the anticipated reversal of many negatives and an increasingly more favorable business environment coupled with our sustained strong business results are among the reasons our stock price has done so well this past yearwe do not worry about the stock price in the short run and we do not worry about quarterly earningsour mindset is that we consistently build the company — if you do the right things the stock price will take care of itselfin the next section i discuss in more detail how we think about building shareholder value for the long run while also taking care of customers employees and communitiesjpmorganchase stock is owned by large institutions pension plans mutual funds and directly by individual investorshowever it is important to remember that in almost all cases the ultimate owner is an individualwell over  million people in

customer satisfaction in multiple waysfor the most part we have seen a rise in these scores as wellit is a given that you will not grow your share – unless you are satisfying your customers – and we know they can always walk across the street to be served by another bank  ijpmorganchase business strategieshow will the company continue to grow what are the organic growth opportunities we have good market share in most busi nesses but we see organic growth opportu nities almost everywhere – some large and some smallfollowing are a few examples consumer  community banking • we recently announced that we will start to expand the consumer branch business into cities like boston philadelphia and washington dcover the next five years we hope to expand to another  new marketswe know the competition is tough but we have much to offerwhen jpmorganchase comes to town we come not just with our consumer branches but also with mortgages investments credit cards private banking small and midsized business banking government business and corporate responsibility initiatives to support our communities • in addition this year we are rolling out many new exciting products and have made several improvements around the customer’s experience including a fully mobile bank pilot finn digital account openings facial recognition in our app the amazon prime rewards visa card and a simpler online application for business banking customers • we also are adding many tools that will help our customers manage their financial affairsfor example in the credit card busi ness we will be allowing our customers to review and decide how and where they want their cards and credit lines to be usedin consumer banking we are adding finan cial planning tools and insights that help customers make the most of their money – and there’s more comingcorporate  investment bank • we see growth opportunities even in fixed income currencies and commodi ties where we already have the  market share atthere may be some under lying growth as the capital markets of the world grow even though this is partially offset by declining margins like we have experienced over the last  yearshowever we see opportunities to gain share in various products and in certain regions where we have low share • this opportunity would be true for invest ment banking toocountry by country and industry by industry there are still plenty of opportunities to increase our low market sharefor example we have  share in the united states but less than  share in asia • in treasury services and custody where our market shares are  and  respectively we believe we can grow significantly by adding bankers building better technology entering new countries building better products and continuing to do a great job for clientsin this business while you make large initial investments in order to grow when you gain clients they usually stick with you for a long time • over time we do expect to expand our corporate  investment bank into new countries which will benefit all the busi nesses within this franchisecommercial banking • this past year commercial banking has completed its expansion into the top  markets in the united states – this will drive growth for decadesand remember when commercial banking opens its doors it also helps drive the growth of our private bank and the corporate  investment bank businesses • commercial banking has added many specialized industry bankers to better serve those specific segments  ijpmorganchase business strategies asset  wealth management • in the united states our share of the ultrahighnetworth market  million or greater iswe believe we have a superior business and that we can grow our share by essentially adding bankers branches and better products • in the highnetworth business  million to  million and the chase affluent business  to  million our market shares are only  and  respec tivelywe have no doubt that we can grow by adding bankers and locations particu larly because we have some exciting new products coming soonthere is no reason we can’t more than double our share over the next  years • we are also adding new products like index funds and exchangetraded funds etf that we believe will help drive growthacross the company in addition we are undertaking many initiatives across the company that will help grow our businesses and better serve our customers • on the payments front we have devel oped multiple products to make wholesale payments better easier and fasterwe are rolling out these products across our platforms and they should help us solidify and grow our position • on the consumer side we have intro duced chase pay the digital equivalent to using a debit or credit card which allows customers to pay online or instore with their mobile phonewe also intro duced zelle a realtime consumerto consumer payments system which allows customers to easily safely and immediately send money to their friends and familywe expect these products to drive lots of customer interactions and make our payments offerings compelling even as some very smart fintech competitors emerge • across the company – not just in tech nology – we have thousands of employees who are data scientists or have advanced degrees in science technology engi neering and mathof the nearly  people in technology at the company more than  are in development and engineering jobs and more than  are in digital technologythink of these talented individuals as driving change across the company • artificial intelligence big data and machine learning are helping us reduce risk and fraud upgrade service improve under writing and enhance marketing across the firmand this is just the beginning • our shared technology infrastructure – our networks data centers and the public and private cloud – decreases costs enhances efficiency and makes all our businesses more productivein addition this allows us to embrace the fact that every business and merchant has its own software and also wants easy integrated access to our products and serviceswe are delivering on that through the creation of a common jpmorganchase api appli cation programming interface store that allows customers to add simple secure payments to their softwareand we are building everything digital – both for indi vidual customers and large corporations – from onboarding to idea generation • increasingly the management teams of consumer  community banking corporate  investment bank commercial banking and asset  wealth management share ideas share platforms and serve each other’s customersthe success of any one business almost always helps the other three  ijpmorganchase business strategies • privacy and safety – we spend an enor mous amount of resources to protect all of our clients and customers from fraud cybersecurity risk and invasion of their privacythese capabilities are extraordinary and we will continue to relentlessly build themas part of this we have consistently warned our customers about privacy issues which will become increasingly critical for all industries as consumers realize the severity of the problemlast year we wrote about a new arrangement with intuit that bears repeating – it briefly described the problem and presented a solution which we hope might set a standard for protecting customers while giving them control of their datafor years we have been describing the risks – to banks and customers – that arise when customers freely give away their bank passcodes to thirdparty services allowing virtually unlimited access to their datacustomers often do not know the liability this may create for them if their passcode is misused and in many cases they do not realize how their data are being usedfor example access to the data may continue for years after customers have stopped using the third party serviceswe recently completed a new arrangement with intuit which we think represents an important step forwardin addition to protecting the bank the customers and even the third party in this case intuit it allows customers to share data – how and when they wantunder this arrangement customers can choose whatever they would like to share and opt to turn these selections on or off as they see fitthe data will be “pushed” to intuit eliminating the need for sharing bank passcodes which protects the bank and our customers and reduces potential liabilities on intuit’s part as wellwe are hoping this sets a new standard for data sharing relationshipsevents from the past year underscore the importance of efforts like thisas questions are raised about how consumers’ infor mation is shared and protected i strongly believe that data privacy and security should be a way in which we and other businesses compete to serve customerswhy is organic growth a better way to grow — and why is it sometimes difficult organic growth is all about hiring and training bankers opening branches improving or innovating new products and building new technologyit is hard workin fact institutionally there is often a lot of resistance to itit’s easier not to add expenses even when they are good for the businessand growing any sales force is usually met by some opposition from – guess who – the existing sales forcesometimes people are afraid the change will take away from their compensation pool or their client baseand it’s hard work to properly recruit and train salespeoplebuilding new products and services is sometimes in conflict with existing products and servicesall of these efforts require huge team coordinationso it’s no surprise that it’s sometimes easier not to push organic growthhowever if you build the right culture where management teams are intensely analytical and critical of their own business’ strengths weaknesses and opportunities you can create great clarity about what those opportunities areif you have strong leaders they have the disci pline and fortitude to develop and execute a forwardlooking growth plan  ijpmorganchase business strategiesis there a conflict between building shareholder value vs serving customers taking care of employees and lifting up communities keeping jpmorganchase a healthy and vibrant company is the best thing we can do for our shareholders our customers our employees and our communitiesbuilding shareholder value is the primary goal of a business but it is simply not possible to do well if a company is not properly treating and serving its customers training and motivating its employees and being a good citizen in the communityif they are all done well it enhances shareholder valuelet me explainwe cannot be a healthy and vibrant company if we are not both delivering financial success and investing for the futureshow me a company that is not financially successful in the long run and i will show you an unsuccessful companythis is particularly true for a bank where confi dence in its stability is criticali should caution however that financial success is a little more complex than shortterm profits – and many investors are completely aware of thisdo not confuse financial success with profits in a quarter or even in a yearall businesses have a different customer and investment life cycle which can be anywhere from one year to  years – think of building new restaurants to developing new airplanes or building electrical gridsgenerally anything our business does to grow will cost money in the short term whether it’s opening branches or conducting research and devel opment rd or launching products but it does not mean that it is not the right financial decisiona company could be losing money on its way to bankruptcy or on its way to a very high return on invested capitaldiligent management teams understand the difference between the two scenarios and invest in a way that will make the company financially successful over timeyou need to invest continually for better products and services so you can serve your customers in the futurea bank cannot simply stop serving its clients or halt investing because of quarterly or annual earnings pressuresit does not work when longterm investing is changed because of shortterm pressures – you cannot stop start training programs and the development of new products among other investmentsyou need to serve your clients and make investments while explaining to shareholders why certain decisions are appropriate at that timeearnings results for any one quarter or even the next few years are fundamentally the result of decisions that were made years and even decades earlier  represents assets under management as well as custody brokerage administration and deposit accounts  represents activities associated

services we provide to themif you are a bank your clients rely on you to always be there regardless of the environ ment – banks are the lender of last resortcontrary to public opinion most banks consistently extended credit to their clients without dramatically raising lending rates throughout the great recessionthe charts on page  show how we have consistently been there for our clients and that they trust us to hold their assetswe simply cannot deliver to our shareholders what they deserve if we do not have highquality motivated committed employeestalented diverse employees deliver lifelong – and satisfied – customersthey also deliver innovative products excellent training and outstanding ideasbasically everything we do emanates from our employeesand all of this creates shareholder valuewe do not try to get the last dollar of profit off of our employees’ or customers’ backswe want longtenured employees and satisfied customers who stay with us year after yearwe would rather earn a fair return and grow our businesses long term than try to maxi mize our profit over any one time periodgreat employees are the result of a healthy open and respectful environment and continual investment in trainingand great employees are the result of management teams that are humble enough to recog nize that they don’t know everything their employees do and therefore are always seeking out constructive feedbackwhile keeping jpmorganchase a healthy and vibrant company is the best thing we can do for our communities there’s a lot more we can doit is important to explain both what we do and why it is so important for our communitiesas the primary engine of economic growth the private sector has an important role to play in making sure the benefits are widely sharedthe future of business and the health of our communities are inextricably linkedwe believe that making the economy work for more people is not simply a moral obliga tion – it’s a business imperativeusing our unique capabilities we can do even more for our communities to help lift them upwe have broad and unique knowl edge around how communities can develop how work skills can be successfully imple mented how businesses can be started how inequality can be addressed how financial health can be secured and how more fami lies can find jobs and affordable housingwe continue to step up our efforts to help communitiesin  we were honored to be ranked by fortune magazine as the  company changing the world in recognition of our work in detroit and other communitieswe do extensive investing to help our communities such as providing affordable housing lending to lower income households and helping advise governments in economic developmentour philanthropic efforts are only a part of what we do – but a very important partthis year we announced we will increase our philanthropic investments byover the next five years we will spend  billion to help drive inclusive growth in communities around the worldour head of corporate responsibility talks about our significant progress and specific measures in more detail in his letter but i would like to highlight a few initiatives • we are helping communities realize their potential as engines of growth and shared prosperityin  we launched our most comprehensive corporate responsibility initiative to date to try to help detroit an iconic city that was long engulfed in economic turmoil and then bankruptcywe view our initiative in detroit as validation of our firm’s model for driving inclusive growththree years in we exceeded our initial  million commitment and we now expect to invest  million in the city bywe see the results on the ground – people are moving back into the city small businesses are being created and  ijpmorganchase business strategies expanded and for the first time in  years property values are on the riseour work in detroit has taught us many important lessons and this past year we extended our model for impact to communities in need in chicago and washington dc • helping people develop the skills they need to compete for today’s jobs can transform lives and strengthen economiesjpmorganchase is investing more than  million to support demanddriven skills training around the worldthrough new skills for youth we launched additional innovation sites to expand highquality careerfocused education programs in cities across the united states and around the world • the path to opportunity begins at an early age but too many young people particularly from disadvantaged backgrounds do not get a fair shot at economic opportunityhigh school graduation rates for young men of color are dangerously low and many who do graduate lack the skills they need to be successful in college or their careersthrough programs like the fellowship initiative tfi we are working to address barriers to opportunitytfi engages young men of color in a comprehensive program that includes academic support leadership development and mentoring during their critical high school yearsthis past year we expanded this program to dallas and recruited new classes of fellows in chicago los angeles and new yorkone hundred percent of these students are graduating from high school and combined they have been accepted into more than  colleges and universi ties across the country • supporting reentry programs is an important part of our effort to create opportunity that strengthens communities and results in a stronger economythe overwhelming majority of americans who are incar cerated return to their communities after they are releasedreducing recidi vism is not only important to returning citizens and their families – it can also have profound implications for public safetynew research from the brookings institution shows that not surprisingly joblessness and incarceration are relatedbarriers to hiring returning citizens come in different forms and some are imposed from the outsidethis year we welcomed the federal deposit insurance corpora tion’s proposed changes to allow banks more flexibility in hiring returning citi zensour responsibility to recruit hire retain and train talented workers extends to this populationearlier this year i visited one of our partnering organiza tions the north lawndale employment network in chicago which gives formerly incarcerated americans a path to well paying jobsthe network also builds a pipeline of trained mechanics for chica go’s growing transportation sectorthis is a winwin for workers employers and the economy as a whole • we are expanding innovative models that enable more people to share in the rewards of a growing economysmall businesses are growing fastest among people of color yet despite their critical role in boosting economic growth these businesses receive only a fraction of traditional loans compared with nonminority entrepre neursin detroit a city with the fourth largest number of minorityowned small businesses we quickly saw the need to address the challenges facing minority entrepreneurstherefore in  we helped launch the entrepreneurs of color fund in detroit to provide underserved entrepreneurs with greater access to the capital and assistance they neededseeing the tremendous success this program has had in detroit we decided to scale this model to the south bronx in new york city as well as san francisco – cities that are experiencing similar challenges  our diverse workforce i believe the door to diversity opens when you run a great company where everyone feels they are treated fairly and with respect – this is what we strive to create at jpmorganchasewe are devoted to diversity for three reasons and each reason stands on its own – combined they are powerfulfirst it is the right thing to do from a moral perspectivesecond it is better for busi ness to include a group of people who represent the various communities where we operateand third if i can pick my team from among all diverse people i will have the best teamwe have more than  employees globally with over  in the united stateswomen represent  of our employeesrecently oliver wyman a leading global management consulting firm issued a report stating that it would be  years before women reach  executive committee representation within global financial services companiesso you might be surprised to learn that today  of the operating committee members reporting to me are women as are approximately  of our firm’s senior leader ship globallythey run major businesses – several units on their own would be among fortune  companiesin addition to having five women on our operating committee – who run asset  wealth management finance global technology legal and human resources – some of our other busi nesses and functions headed by women include consumer banking credit card usprivate bank usmergers  acquisitions global equity capital markets global research global custody regula tory affairs global philanthropy our us branch network our controller and firmwide marketingi believe we have some of the best women leaders in the corporate world globallyin addition to gender diversity  of our firm’s population is ethnically diverse in the united stateswe are proud of jpmorganchase’s industry recog nition for its diversity and inclusion effortsin  we received more than  awards that recog nize the firm and represent the diversity of our employeesadvancing black leaders in  we introduced advancing black leaders abl an expanded diversity strategy focused on increased hiring retention and development of talent from within the black communitythis specifically recognized that — with this popula tion — we should and could do morewe set up a separate group whose sole purpose is to help do this betterfrom training to retention to recruiting and hiring new employees our intensified efforts are starting to pay offtwo years into this initiative we are seeing encouraging resultsat executive levels we closed  with a noticeable increase in headcount  black managing directors globally up from  a year earlier driven by recruiting new talent and promoting existing talentin addition we are

in every businessyou should assume we do this internally at a far more detailed level than what is presented herewe need a fortress balance sheet so we can continue to do our job — regardless of the

accounting is an absolute necessitywe have said this before and it remains true jpmorganchase has to be prepared to handle multiple complex global and interre lated types of riskwe do this in many ways – let me share a few the federal reserve’s comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar stress test estimated what our losses would be through a severely adverse event lasting over nine quarters – an event that is worse than what actually happened during the great recession eg high unemployment and  includes only the  banks participating in ccar in  as well as bear stearns

a scenario we would lose  billion over the ensuing nine quarters which is easily manageable by jpmorganchase’s capital basemy view is that we would make money in almost every quarter in that scenario and this is supported by our having earned approximately  billion pretax over the course of the nine quarters during the actual financial crisis ofwe are believers in the ccar stress testing process although our view is that it could be simplified and improvedour share holders should know that the ccar stress test is only an annual testto explain how serious we are about stress testing you should know that we run several hundred tests a week – including a number of complicated potentially disastrous scenarios – to prepare our company for almost every type of eventwhile we never know exactly how and when the next major crisis will unfold these rigorous exercises keep us constantly preparedthe chart above shows just how much capital is retained by the ccar banksto remind you ccar forecasts the losses of each bank over the next nine quarters as if all of them went through a crisis worse than the crisis in  and that each bank performed as poorly as the worst bank throughout that crisisthe chart above also shows that even in the extremely unlikely event that it could happen this way ie that each bank is the worst bank there is plenty of capital in the system to absorb these eventsthis does not include the fact that the new regulatory requirements would appropriately force any bank to take corrective action long before it gets into serious trouble  ijpmorganchase business strategieswhat risks worry us the most and what could go wrong the global economy across asia and japan latin america and europe and the united states has been doing well – better than most would have expected a year agothe united states in particular may be strengthening as we speakthe competitive tax system a more constructive regulatory environ ment and very high consumer and business confidence are increasing indications that the economy will likely expandunemploy ment may very well drop to  this year and there are more and more signals that business will improve capital expenditures and raise payrollscredit is readily available though still not enough in some mort gage marketswages jobs and household formation are increasinghousing is in short supplyunderlying consumer and corpo rate credit have been relatively strongall these signs lead to a positive outlook for the economy for the next year or soi will not spend time dwelling on geopolitics here which can – but rarely does – upset the global economyin the next section i talk about serious policy issues that could harm economic growth including america’s rela tionship with china and potential disrup tions to global tradein this section i focus on some of the risks in the financial system and how we go about managing themwe will be prepared for brexitso far it has turned out pretty much like we expected it’s complex and hard to figure out and the longterm impact to the united kingdom is still uncertainlast year we spoke about whether brexit would cause the european union to unravel or pull together – and it appears particularly with the new leadership in france and the steady hand in germany that the countries might pull togetheras for jpmorganchase fortunately we have the resources to be prepared for a hard brexit as we must beit essentially means moving  jobs around europe in the short term and modifying some of our legal entities to be able to conduct business the day after brexitwhat we do not know – and will not know until the negotiations are complete – is what the end state will look likealthough unlikely there is the possibility that we could stay exactly as we are todayunfortunately the worst outcome would be much of london’s financial center moving to the continent over timewe hope for all involved that this outcome will not be the casewe cannot do enough as a country when it comes to cybersecurityi cannot overemphasize the importance of cybersecurity in americathis is a critical issue not just for financial companies but also for utilities technology companies elec trical grids and othersit is an arms race and we need to do whatever we can to protect the united states of americaour bank is extremely good at cybersecurity and client protectionhowever cyber law in the united states is inadequate regarding banks and government entitieswe need to be allowed to work even closer with our government in real time to properly protect the financial systemin addition we need to have better international cyber laws and include them in trade agreements like we do in maritime and aviation lawscountries should know what they are responsible for – and what redress companies or countries have – when either a bad state actor or crimi nals in a state cause extreme problemsin the financial markets we must be prepared for the full range of possibilities and probabilitieswe strive to try to understand the possibili ties and probabilities of potential outcomes so as to be prepared for any outcomewe analyze multiple scenarios in addition to the stress testing i wrote about earlier in this sectionso regardless of what you think about the probabilities we need to be prepared for the possibilities including the worst casein essence we try to manage the company such that all possibilities including the “fat tails” the worstcase scenarios cannot hurt the company  ijpmorganchase business strategies we try to intelligently thoughtfully and analytically make decisions and manage risk and not overly rely on modelswhen i hear people talk about banks taking risks it often sounds as if we are taking big bets like you would at a casino or a racetrackthis is the complete opposite of realityevery loan we extend is a proprietary riskevery new facility we build is a riskwhether we are adding branches or bankers – or making markets or expanding opera tions – we perform extensive analytics and stress testing to challenge our assumptionsin short we look at the best and worstcase scenarios before we “take risk” much of what we do as a bank is to mitigate or manage the risk being takeni think you would be impressed by the thoroughness and riskmit igating approach demonstrated at our risk committee meetingsat these meetings we have lawyers compliance risk manage ment bankers and technologists – folks with decades of experience who challenge each other and ensure we have thought about every possible angleand since we know we will be wrong sometimes we almost always look at the worst possible case – to ensure jpmorganchase can survive any situationthis is not risk taking on the order of taking a guess – it is intelligent thoughtful analyt ical decision makingwe rely heavily on detailed and constantly improving models as a foundational element of that analysisbut we are cognizant of the fact that models by their nature are backward looking and have a difficult time adjusting to material items including the following • the character and integrity of those with whom you are doing business • changing technology as it impacts indus tries including the banking industry • future changes in the law or even how the law might be interpreted differently  years from now • deteriorating international competiveness as what happened to our tax code • emerging competitive threats • changes in industrial structure eg new sources of competition • political influence and unexpected litigation • public sector fiscal challenges demo graphic changes and challenges managing the nation’s healthcare resources there are other items – but you get the pointjudgment which will never be perfect all of the time cannot be removed from the processvolatility and rapidly moving markets should surprise no onewe are always prepared for volatility and rapidly moving markets – they should surprise no onei am a little perplexed when people are surprised by large market movesoftentimes it takes only an unexpected supplydemand imbalance of a few percent and changing sentiment to dramatically move marketswe have seen that condition occur recently in oil but i have also seen it multiple times in my career in cotton corn aluminum soybeans chicken beef copper iron – you get the pointeach industry or commodity has continually changing supply and demand different investment horizons to add or subtract supply varying marginal and fixed costs and different inventory and supply linesin all cases extreme volatility can be created by slightly changing factorsit is fundamentally the same for stocks bonds and interest rates and currencieschanging expectations whether around inflation growth or recession yes there will be another recession – we just don’t know when supply and demand sentiment and other factors can cause drastic volatilityone scenario that we must be prepared for is the possibility that the reversal of quantitative easing qe by the world’s central banks — in a new regulatory environment — will be different from what people expectthe united states has had subpar economic growth over the last eight years i believe this is due to a lot of poor policy decisions that i discuss in the next section as well as new  ijpmorganchase business strategies demographic realitiesour growth cumula tively in this expansion has been about  while a more normal recovery would have seen growth of over  by nowhowever with recent reforms the situation may be improvingas inflation wages and growth seem to be modestly increasing the federal reserve has started to raise interest rates and reverse qeimportantly as long as rates are rising because the economy is strengthening and inflation is contained it is reasonable to expect that the reversal of qe will not be painfulthe benefits of a strong economy are more important than the negative impact from modest increases in interest ratessince qe has never been done on this scale and we don’t completely know the myriad effects it has had on asset prices confidence capital expenditures and other factors we cannot possibly know all of the effects of its reversalwe have to deal with the possibility that at one point the federal reserve and other central banks may have to take more drastic action than they currently antici pate – reacting to the markets not guiding the marketsa simple scenario under which this could happen is if inflation and wages grow more than people expecti believe that many people underestimate the possibility of higher inflation and wages which means they might be underestimating the chance that the federal reserve may have to raise rates faster than we all thinkwhile in the past interest rates have been lower and for longer than people expected they may go higher and faster than people expectif this happens it is useful to look at how the table is set – what are all the things that are different or better or worse than during prior crises particularly the last one – and try to think through the possible effectsthere are many pluses things that are better than during the last crisis in  • far more capital and less leverage in the banking system • far more liquidity in the banking system • more collateral in the markets • less total shortterm secured financing which is also more properly collateralized • less leveraged lending • money market funds that are far safer due to regulatory requirements around credit standards and liquidation • healthier consumers in terms of both employment and disposable income and their debt burden is still modest relative to their disposable income while debt service burdens are historically low • the absence of massive losses in the mortgage marketsmortgage underwriting since  has been rather pristineand while losses will go up in a recession it will be nothing like what happened in the great recessionin the  crisis losses totaled more than  trillionthe market place realization that financial institutions and investors were going to experience massive losses is a primary reason why there was a devastating loss of confidence in the financial systemand there are some modest negatives or potentially important differences than during the last crisis • far more money than before about  tril lion of assets which represents about  of total mutual fund longterm assets is managed passively in index funds or etfs both of which are very easy to get out ofsome of these funds provide far more liquidity to the customer than the under lying assets in the fund and it is reason able to worry about what would happen if these funds went into large liquidation  ijpmorganchase business strategies • even more procyclicality has been built into the systemriskweighted assets will go up as will collateral requirements – and this is on top of the procyclicality of loan loss reserving • market making is dramatically smaller than in the past eg aggregate primary dealer positions of bonds – including treasury and agency securities mortgagebacked securities and corporates – averaged  billion in  vs an average of  billion todaywhile in the past that total may have been too high virtually every asset manager says today it is much harder to buy and sell securities particu larly the less liquid securities • liquidity requirements while much higher now have an element of rigidity built in that did not exist beforebanks will be unable to use that liquidity when they most need to do so – to make loans or intermediate marketsthey have a “red line” they cannot cross they are required to maintain hard and fast liquidity requirementsas clients demand more liquidity from their banks the banks essentially will be unable to provide it • there has been an excessive reliance on models which i spoke about earlier in this section • the continuous politicization of complex policy is an issueno one can believe that very detailed and complex global liquidity or capital requirements should be set by politicians • no banks to the rescue this time – banks got punished for helping in the last goroundit would be a reasonable expectation that with normal growth and inflation approaching  the year bond could or should be trading at aroundand the short end should be trading at around ½ these would be fairly normal histor ical experiencesand this is still a little lower than the fed is forecasting under these conditionsit is also a reasonable explanation and one that many economists believe that today’s rates of the year bond trading below  are due to the large purchases of us debt by the federal reserve and othersthis situation is completely reversingsometime in the next year or so many of the major buyers of us debt including the federal reserve will either stop their buying or reverse their purchases think foreign exchange managers or central banks in japan or china and europeso far only one central bank the federal reserve has started to reverse qe – and even that in a minor wayhowever by the end of this year the fed has indicated it might reduce its holding of treasuries by up to  billion a quarterand finally the us government will need to sell more than  billion a quarter to fund its deficitthere are two offsetting factors to the large sales of treasuriesone is that as the federal reserve sells it reduces excess reserves which requires banks to buy treasuries to meet liquidity requirementsbut we do not fully know the extent of this scenario and it certainly won’t be dollar for dollarthe second factor as some argue is that the us trade deficit effectively forces foreign coun tries to use their dollars to buy treasuries although this is not completely true – they can buy other us securities or assets or sell their dollarsso we could be going into a situation where the fed will have to raise rates faster and or sell more securities which certainly could lead to more uncertainty and market vola tilitywhether this would lead to a reces sion or not we don’t know – but even that  ijpmorganchase business strategies is not the worst caseif growth in america is accelerating which it seems to be and any remaining slack in the labor markets is disappearing – and wages start going up as do commodity prices – then it is not an unreasonable possibility that inflation could go higher than people might expectas a result the federal reserve will also need to raise rates faster and higher than people might expectin this case markets will get more volatile as all asset prices adjust to a new and maybe notsopositive environ mentremember that former chairman of the federal reserve paul volcker increased the discount rate by  basis points on a saturday night back in  in response to a serious doubledigit inflation problemand when markets opened the next business day the fed funds rate went up by over  basis pointsalso remember that the federal reserve is operating with extremely different monetary transmission mechanisms than in the pastthe old “money multiplier” has been superseded by the new capital and liquidity requirementstoday’s “excess reserves” reserves once considered in excess of what banks were required to post in cash at the federal reserve – fundamen tally reserves that could be lent out are not lendable although we still don’t completely understand the effect of thisthere is a risk that volatile and declining markets can lead to market panicfinancial markets have a life of their own and are sometimes barely connected to the real economy most people don’t pay much attention to the financial markets nor do the markets affect them very muchvolatile markets andor declining markets gener ally have been a reaction to the economic environmentmost of the major downturns in the market since the great depression reflect negative future expectations due to a potential or real recessionin almost all of these cases stock markets fell credit losses increased and credit spreads rose among other disruptionsthe biggest negative effect of volatile markets is that it can create market panic which could start to slow the growth of the real economythe years  and  are the only real examples in the united states in the past  years when panic in the markets caused large reduc tions in investments and hiringi wouldn’t give this scenario very high odds – in fact i would give it low oddsmost people think of those events as oneinathousandyear floodsbut because the experience of  is so recent there is always a chance that people may overreactif truly negative events started to unfold we could expect the federal reserve with its enormous authority and power to take strong action including changing regulations if the fed thought it necessaryin any event our shareholders should rest assured that we will weather it allthere are a couple of things we all could do to be more prepared for this situation and other disruptions which i will discuss in the next few paragraphsbanks and regulators need to be more forward looking and less backward looking — particularly when examining risks across the systemone day there will be another crisis and financial institutions and central banks will need to respondthe financial system is far more safe and sound than in the pastbut in spite of all the regulations put in place i worry about whether we have properly prepared for the next crisisthe financial stability oversight council was created to oversee the whole system as appropriate but we have not yet really worked collabo ratively to prepare tabletop exercises about what would happen across the system under difficult situationswhen the next crisis begins regardless of where or how it starts multiple actors in the system will take actions – either out of neces sity ie they need cash or sentiment ie they want to reduce riskthis will happen across passive index and etf funds insur ance companies banks and nonbanksas individual actors stop providing credit and liquidity in the marketplace we need to do a better job of understanding how this might unfoldand all this will be happening under a different regulatory regime from before  ijpmorganchase business strategies we also need to be more forward looking in many other areasdoing so will create a better and stronger system – not doing so will actually create additional riskfollowing are a few examples almost all risk and control functions think antimoney laundering know your customer kyc and compliance could be better performed if we worked with the regulators to streamline what we do and use advanced techniques like artificial intelli gence and machine learning to improve the outcomesthe same is true for fraud preven tion and customer servicewe must also be far more aggressive in protecting ourselves from cybersecurity risks both within the banking system and across the financial system think of nonbanks money managers clearinghouses exchanges etchow is the company dealing with bureaucracy and complacency that often infect large companies modest regulatory reform can strengthen the financial system improve the functioning of our markets and enhance economic growth for all americanswhile the regulatory environment is appro priately much stricter than it once was we can simplify it and even strengthen it by ensuring that it is globally fair and trans parent and includes continuous regular review and appropriate modificationregulators now have begun to simplify coor dinate and reduce overlapping regulationsi won’t repeat the details that i’ve discussed in prior letters – many of them were also discussed in treasury reports issued by the governmentbut suffice it to say modest regulatory reform could allow banks to expand carefully improve access to credit eg mortgages and small business loans and improve market making and the func tioning of the money marketsi was recently at a senior leadership offsite meeting talking about bureaucracywe heard bureaucracy described as “a necessary outcome of complex businesses operating in complex international and regulatory environments” this is hogwashbureau cracy is a diseasebureaucracy drives out good people slows down decision making kills innovation and is often the petri dish of bad politicslarge organizations in fact all organizations should be thought of as always slowing down and getting more bureaucratictherefore leaders must continually drive for speed and accuracy to eliminate waste and kill bureaucracywhen you get in great shape you don’t stop exercisingafter years of increasing regulations there has been a temptation to blame some of our bureaucracy and ridiculous processes on regulationsthat too is mostly hogwashit is easy to find excuses not to attempt to reimagine how things could be done better and more efficientlybelow are five examples of how we’ve set out to combat this condition meetingsinternal meetings can be a giant waste of time and moneyi am a vocal propo nent of having fewer of themif a meeting is absolutely necessary the organizer needs to have a wellplanned focused agenda with preread materials sent in advancethe right people have to be in the room and followup actions must be welldocumentedjust as important each meeting should only run for as long as it needs to and lead  ijpmorganchase business strategies to real decisionsin addition there should be clarity around who chairs the meetingthe chair is responsible for making sure all issues are properly raised facilitating effec tive and productive discussions and driving to decisionswar roomsjust as important we need to simplify our processes while accelerating the pace of change and driving new innovationslast year the operating committee created a number of “war rooms” – spanning lines of business geographies functions and levels – to make our firm more agile and to put a laser focus on several hotbutton issues like client onboarding and vendor and third party managementeach war room is staffed with a dedicated group of employees tasked with solving specific problems within a set number of weeks or monthsyou would be amazed at how quickly our employees can come up with new solutions when they are galvanized around solving a problem in a concentrated time periodthese teams have been so successful in driving bureaucracy out of the decisionmaking process that we plan to deploy more war rooms when crit ical needs arisethese war rooms are very similar to how we operated when we made complex acquisitionsessentially they cause better and faster dissemination of infor mation to those who need to know – and faster and more productive decision making because everyone involved is in the roomreimaginingyou can take any part of your business and reimagine ityou can get all the right people in the room to think about a certain process and reimagine how it could be done from the ground upour know your customer problemsolving team is a good example of the results our reimag ining and war rooms can drivecomprising all lines of business the group was given eight weeks to reimagine our kyc processes to improve the customer experience without sacrificing controlsby applying a sharp firmwide focus to the kyc protocols the team identified several kyc questions and protocols that had become outdated or been made redundant by recent controlsone customer could be subjected to multiple kyc processes depending on the line of business and channel usedas a result the team streamlined kyc questions substan tially and identified a number of processes that could be eliminated which will allow for a better customer experience while still maintaining a strong control environmentthis war room team’s results not only helped disparate lines of business identify duplicative processes but also enabled the team to update the firm’s prioritiesfighting complacency by being selfcriticalcomplacency is another diseaseit is usually borne out of arrogance or success but it is a guarantee of future failureour competitors are not resting on their laurels – nor can wethe only way to fight complacency is to always analyze our own actions and point out our own weaknessesit’s great to openly celebrate our successes but when the door is closed management should emphasize the negativesusing agile management to create speedagile technology generally means using new forms of technology – think cloud computing for example – to enable small teams of programmers to build and prop erly execute new programs and products rapidly and effectivelythe concept of agile management goes hand in hand with this approachsmall teams of people respon sible for products and services work with technologists to improve the customer experienceto do this they must be given the necessary authority and resourcesit is also important they understand that they can make mistakes without punishment  ijpmorganchase business strategies having a firstrate management team in place is probably the board’s highest prioritytherefore management succession planning is a key focus of our boardthe board knows the firm’s senior leaders well through unfet tered access and significant interactionwhile the board and i have agreed that i will continue in my current role for approxi mately five more years we both believe that under all timing scenarios the firm has in place several highly capable successorsearly in the year we announced that daniel pinto ceo of our corporate  investment bank and gordon smith ceo of consumer  community banking have been appointed copresidents and chief operating officers of the companyin addition to their currentwhat are the firm’s views on succession roles daniel and gordon will work closely with me to help drive critical firmwide func tionsour other outstanding ceos mary erdoes asset  wealth management and doug petno commercial banking along with our cfo marianne lake took on expanded responsibilities last year and have played progressively more significant roles part nering across the firm in helping to manage the companyi also want to say how grateful i am to our operating committee and to all of the leaders of our organization for the extraordinary job they do  iipublic policy the following messages are worth repeating from last year’s letter the united states needs to ensure that we maintain a healthy and vibrant economythis is what fuels job creation raises the standard of living and creates opportunity for those who are hurting while positioning us to invest in education technology and infrastructure – in a programmatic and sustainable way – to build a better and safer future for our country and its peopleand in a world with so many security threats and challenges we need to maintain the best militaryamer ica’s military will be the best in the world only as long as we have the best economy in the worldbusiness plays a critical role as an engine of economic growth – particularly our largest globally competitive american businessesas an example the  largest compa nies in america out of approximately  million employ nearly  million people in the united states and nearly all of their fulltime employees receive full medical and retirement benefits as well as exten sive trainingin addition these companies account for more than  of the roughly  trillion spent annually on capital expen dituresthese expenditures and research and development spending drive productivity and innovation which ultimately drive job creation across the entire economyof the approximately  million people who work in the united states  million work in private enterprisewe hold in high regard the  million people employed by the government or in the public sector – teachers police officers firefighters and othersbut we could not pay for those jobs if the other  million workers were not actively producing america’s gross domestic product gdpsmall businesses are a critical engine of economic growthsmall and large busi nesses are symbiotic – they are each other’s customers and they help drive each other’s growththey are integral to our large busi ness ecosystemat jpmorganchase for example we support more than  million small business clients including hundreds of small banks  middle market compa nies and approximately  corporations and investor clientsadditionally we rely on services from nearly  vendors many of which are small and midsized companiesbusiness taken as a whole is the source of almost all job creationand we need to main tain trust and confidence in our businesses as in all of our institutionsconfidence is a “secret sauce” that costs nothing but it helps the economy growa strong and vibrant private sector including big companies is good for the average americanentrepre neurship and free enterprise with strong ethics and high standards are something to root for – not attackto support this we need a progrowth policy environment from the government that provides a degree of certainty around long standing issues that have proved frustrat ingly elusive to solvethe most pressing areas where government business and other stakeholders can find common ground should include tax reform infrastructure investment education reform more favor able trade agreements and a sensible immi gration

federal reserve board march   iipublic policywhat has gone wrong in public policy in the last several years i have spent a good amount of time – in both these letters and elsewhere – talking about public policysome of the policies directly relate to jpmorganchase while others are more indi rect but have a large effect on the future of the united states of america on the global economy and therefore on our companywith all of america’s exceptional strengths it seems clear to me that something is holding us backas we have already pointed out our economic growth has been anemicour economy has grown approximately  in the last eight years but this stands in contrast with prior average recoveries where growth would have been more than  over an eightyear periodthe chart below on the left shows thislast year i laid out in detail an extensive list of things i thought were holding us back and it bears repeating here because just as it took many years for these obstacles to develop it is going to take sustained effort over many years to right the coursewhen you look at this list in totality it is significant and fairly shockingmost of these areas have become consistently worse over the last  to  years and it is hard to argue that they did not meaningfully damage the country’s economic growthit is also important to point out that i have never seen an economic model that accounts for the extremely damaging aspects of these items these items don’t include the trillions of dollars we have spent on warre lated expendituresand whether you were for or against these wars they certainly did not add to american productivity this is not secular stagnation – this represents senseless and misguided policies  iipublic policy • we had a hugely and increasingly uncom petitive tax system driving companies’ capital and brainpower overseas • excessive regulations for both large and small companies reduced growth and business formationthe ease of starting a business in the united states worsened with small business formation dropping to the lowest rate in  years • the chart on the bottom right of page  shows how tepid bank credit growth was in general during this recoveryremember bank credit growth directly relates to economic growth although it’s often difficult to figure out the cause and effectbut there is no question that the things that reduce credit availability in turn reduce growthone area where we know this happened was in the mortgage markethousehold formation has been slow because many young adults have had a difficult time finding work and with the help of their families have gone back for more schoolingthat is slowly reversingbut the inability to reform mortgage markets has dramatically reduced mort gage availabilityin fact our analysis shows that conservatively more than  trillion in mortgage loans might have been made over a fiveyear period • labor force participation – particularly among men aged  – dropped dramat icallyan estimated  million americans are currently addicted to opioids in  a staggering  americans died because of opioid overdoses and some studies show this is one of the major reasons why men aged  are perma nently out of workeven worse  of today’s youth ages  are not eligible for military service essentially due to a lack of proper education basic reading and writing skills or health issues often obesity or diabetes • our schools are leaving too many behindin some inner city schools fewer than  of students graduate and of those who do a significant number are not prepared for employmentadditionally many of our high schools vocational schools and community colleges do not properly prepare today’s younger gener ation for the available professionallevel jobs many of which pay a multiple of the minimum wage • infrastructure is a disasterit took eight years to get a man to the moon from idea inception to completion yet it now can sometimes take a decade to simply get the permits to build a bridge or a new solar fieldthe country that used to have the best infrastructure on the planet by most measures is now not even ranked among the top  developed nations according to the basic requirement index • our immigration policies fail us in numerous waysforty percent of foreign students who receive advanced degrees in science technology and math  students annually have no legal way of staying here although many would choose to do somost students from countries outside the united states pay full freight to attend our universities but many are forced to take the training back homefrom my vantage point that means one of our largest exports is brainpower • our nation’s healthcare costs are twice the amount per person compared with most developed nations • our litigation system is increasingly arbitrary capricious wasteful and slow  iipublic policy economic analysis provides a sense of the costs associated with misguided policiesthe congressional budget office estimates the cost of failing to pass immigration reform earlier this decade at  of gdp a yearan international monetary fund study suggests that a  of gdp rise in infrastructure investment in  would have delivered a similar boost to advanced economy gdp over the subsequent decadejpmorgan analysis indicates that the cost of not reforming the mortgage markets could be as high as  of gdp a yeartaken together with the costs of excessive regulation and a depressed prime age labor participation rate it is easy to conclude that corrections in policy could add more than  of gdp annuallyand this does not account for many of the items i mentioned in the prior listthe end result is that our economy is still leaving many behindmuch of this is probably selfinflictedwhile a job used to provide a ticket to the middle class today more people are getting stuck in lowwage workhistorically we’ve thought of these jobs as providing the first rung on a career ladder – a chance for workers to prove them selves and develop skills before moving on to other better paying jobsbut a growing number of americans are left hanging on this first rung during the mids only one in five minimumwage workers was still at minimum wage a year latertoday that number is nearly one in threeso while the economy has not performed badly and has done amazingly well for a handful – lowskilled and even middleskilled wages have gone down leaving large swaths of americans behindit is surprising that many younger people in the united states who are effectively going to inherit the wealthiest nation on the planet seem to be pessimistic about our future and capitalismbut falling expectations the failure of our economy to lift up everyone and the continual deprecation of society and its leaders have led to huge amounts of discontent and unrestall these issues are fixable but we should ask ourselves how we got it wrong in the first placepoor public policy — how has this happened america has been an amazingly resilient countryand we hope it will reset and get back on trackbut it is hard to look at the last  years and not think that it has been getting increasingly worse and we should not assume that it will get better on its ownbefore we try to address what we can do to fix it it is important to look at why it has gotten worsehere are my theories • the world is getting faster and more complex making speed and analytics all the more importantbut the structure of our political parties and institutions has barely changed in  yearsthey may not be set up for success – organized in a way to enable them to deal with today’s challenges • critical thinking analysis of facts and proper policy formation have become extremely difficult in a politicized and mediasaturated environmentoften politics misuses facts to justify a position • we are effectively crippled when it comes to fixing our problems even when they are totally predictablepuerto rico’s bankruptcy detroit’s bankruptcy unfunded pension plans the job skills gap and crumbling bridges and tunnels are prime examples • we focus too much on the short termfor example president bill clinton and i don’t mean to pick him out specifically usually gets credit for driving a strong economybut the excessive mortgage lending incented and promulgated by the federal government i am in no way saying that banks and investors didn’t play a part too is part of the reason the economy at that time did wellit blew up  iipublic policy late in president george wbush’s termthere are many examples of presidents getting credit or blame for scenarios that had nothing to do with their governingwe simply learned the wrong lessonsand in the short run we tend to simplistically look for scapegoats instead of solutions • rogoff and reinhart wrote in their book this time is different that it takes a long time to recover from a financial crisisbut this was often due to poor policy or over reaction to the financial crisis and while history teaches us that maybe we should expect this reaction in the next crisis it does not have to be true over and overwe have a difficult time learning from the past • a famous politician once said “don’t let a good crisis go to waste” i think he really meant “let’s use the crisis to get some good important things done” it appears first off we should find it rather easy to recognize that bad thinking often leads to bad policymakinglet me list a few of the culprits • binary argumentswhen people argue as if there are binary solutions the argument is almost always wrongwhen people say you should not do something because it is like going down a “slippery slope” it generally is not a good argumentin the modern world there are reasons to cali brate various parts of policy instead of just denying the argument altogether • “they complain too much” argumentswhen a point has been made and someone calls it a complaint the point is diminished right awaywhen someone complains about something a better response is to think about where or how the person might be right or partially right • not listening to one anotheri tell my liberal friends to read columnists like arthur brooks and george willand i tell my conservative friends to read writers like tom friedman that politicians sometimes use a crisis to justify implementing their own agenda • here’s another example we all know that the us healthcare system needs to be reformedmany have advocated getting on the path to universal healthcare for all americansthe creation of obamacare while a step in the right moral direc tion was not well doneamerica has  million people who have insurance –  million through private enterprise and  million through medicare and medicaidobamacare slightly expanded both and created exchanges that insure  million peoplebut it did very little to fix our broken healthcare system and has in fact torn up the body politic over  years – and this tumult may go on for another  yearswe can fix this problem through intelligent thoughtful analytical and comprehensive policy • not asking what outcomes you really want to achieve • not working with experts who know the most about a subject • trying to create too many zerotolerance environments when they are often not meritedexamples include situations where people need to be able to commu nicate with each other and work through miscommunications and mistakes of judg ment rather than criminal and unethical behavior where a zerotolerance standard should be applied equally to all • this way of thinking also applies to institu tionswe should not destroy the credibility or the effectiveness of institutions – public or private – for the mistakes or misdeeds of a fewthis may feel good in the short term but will not serve us well over the long termwe all generally know what a good decisionmaking process looks like – and we applaud it – whether in business or in congress  iipublic policy people don’t think about the challenges in their everyday lives as being democratic or republican issues – and our political leaders need to stop thinking that waywe need a wellperforming competent govern ment to thrive as a nationclearly there are things that only the government can do – and must do well – such as having a strong military and ensuring an efficient and properly functioning justice systemthe federal government maintains most of our nation’s transportation systems and we need state and local governments to do a good job in terms of education policing and other important functionssome argue that the government should be doing morebut when many americans think of the government delivering services they think of the endless bureaucracy and paperwork associated with the internal revenue service the uspostal service and the department of veterans affairs – none of which would consistently get high markswe all can agree that the lack of true collab oration and an unwillingness to address our most pressing policy issues have contributed to the divisive and polarized environment we have todaycertainly there is plenty of blame to go around on this fronthowever rather than looking back it now is more important than ever for the business community and government to come together to find mean ingful solutionsthis cannot be done by government or business aloneby collaborating and applying some good old american cando ingenuity there is nothing we can’t accomplishby working together business government and the nonprofit sector can ensure and maintain a healthy and vibrant economy into the future – creating jobs fostering economic mobility and main taining sustainable economic growthulti mately this translates to an improved quality of life and greater financial security for those in the united states struggling to make ends meetit also represents a significant step in restoring public faith in two of our greatest democratic institutions in the united states business and governmentworking together will allow us to move toward a prosperous future for all americansmany examples of business and government working together already have produced positive outcomesbusinesses have played a large role in trying to help detroit recoverbusinesses started the veteran jobs missionwith a goal of  million jobs the coalition of businesses has already helped  us veterans get work and the number is still growingmany businesses have worked closely with the education system mostly locally to support charter schools voca tional schools and community colleges to provide skills training that prepares students for productive employmentwe believe that collaboration can create even better outcomes in education healthcare and job creation while shoring up pension plans and rebuilding our cities and communities across the nationour founding fathers studied and worked hard to design a strong and permanent democracythey perfected a constitution to protect our basic liberties building in protec tions to temper some of our worst attributes and incent our best onesif they were here with us today i believe they would recognize that our government institutions are stuck in the mud – too slow and inadequate for the job at handtherefore they would study and work hard within the constitution to redesign and reformulate how government should function so that it works properlywe will eventually need to do the samethe need for solutions through collaborative competent government  iipublic policya competitive business tax system is a key pillar of a growth strategyit isn’t easy to stay competitive in an increas ingly global marketplace and national tax policy was one critical area where we were falling behindover the last  years as the world reduced its tax rates america did notour previous tax code was increasingly uncompetitive overly complex and loaded with special interest provisions that created winners and losersthis was driving down capital investment reducing productivity and causing wages to remain stagnantthe good news is that the recent changes in the us tax system have many of the key ingre dients to fuel economic expansion a busi ness tax rate that will make the us compet itive around the world provisions to free us companies to bring back profits earned overseas and importantly tax relief for the middle classthe passage of tax reform is critical because strong businesses create jobs and higher wagesbefore tax reform was passed  of the ceos of leading us companies said they would increase hiring if tax reform were enacted and  would increase capital spending – and we already are seeing these effectshundreds of companies like ours are stepping up by investing in their employees and in initiatives to address challenges facing communitiesi must confess i don’t understand how anyone could believe an uncompetitive tax system would be good for the united states – whether the current economic environ ment was good or badthe damage has been cumulativehere is one example a recent study by the accounting firm ernst  young found that under a  corporate income tax rate us companies would have acquired  trillion in crossborder assets during  instead of losing  billion in such assets to foreign buyerssimply put this means the united states would have kept  companies under us ownership during the past  years if they had paid taxes at a rate competitive with other countries that have modernized their corporate tax codestoday’s competitive us corporate tax rate will reduce incentives for us companies to relocate abroad or be purchased by foreign companiesthere is a reason why it has taken  years for comprehensive tax reform to take place in this country it is complicated work and navigating competing interests is hardi am pleased that we did the right thing – not the easy thingcongress took a historic step in  to reform america’s broken and outdated tax codecoming together to get that work done shows that we can take on tough issues that have been holding us backi believe tax reform will have both short and longterm benefitsin the short term we already are seeing some companies increasing capital expenditures hiring and raising wagesof course that will not be enough to offset all the immediate benefits associated with tax reformsome argue that the added cash flow going to dividends and buybacks is a negative – it is notit simply represents capital finding a higher and better use than the current owner has with itand that higher and better use will be reinvest ment in companies innovation rd or consumptionthinking this is a bad thing is just wrongtax reform’s real benefit will be the longterm cumulative effect of retained and reinvested capital in the united states which means more companies innovation and employment will stay in this countrythe united states should always aim to have a competitive business tax systemit should not be traded off against other objectives  along with a more constructive regulatory and business environment and our strong business performance this reform has led our company to recently announce a  billion fiveyear comprehensive investment to help its employees while supporting job and local economic growth in the united statesjpmorganchase plans to build up to  chase branches in  new markets and hire up to  additional employees over the next five yearsthese employees will support our branch growth and more lending to small businesses and homeownerstoday chase has roughly  branches across  us states and for a long time we have wanted to expand beyond our current foot printthe heart of our company is our brancheswe serve  million us households — one out of every two us families is a chase customernearly every line of business operates out of our branches in some waywe are not in some major markets including boston philadelphia and washington dc but consumer banking has started the formal application process for national expansionas i previously said when chase enters a commu nity it enters with the full force of jpmorganchase behind itwe hire peoplewe lend to and support local businesseswe help customers with banking lending and savingand our philanthropic programs help make these communities strongerour company has made a significant economic impact in all the communities in which we operate and we’re excited to become an even more relevant part of many otherswe’re also investing in our employeeswe want to have the best people periodwe know happy customers start with happy employees and we want to be the best place to work everywhere we do businessfor the second time in two years we’re raising wages for  employeesfor employees making between  and  an hour we will raise hourly wages to between  and  depending on the local cost of livingthis is the right thing to do and we believe it puts us well above the average hourly wage for most marketsthese increases are on top of the value of the firm’s full benefits package which averages  for employees in this pay rangebut the improvements won’t stop therewe’re reducing medical plan deductibles by  per year for employees making less than  — this essen tially makes the deductible  for those employees who take care of themselves by meeting minimal wellness and preventative program requirementscredit is essential to a healthy economy and growth and our new investments include sizable increases in lending to small businesses and homeownersthrough commercial banking and business banking we will hire  new bankers and help expand small business lending by  — or  billion — over three years while entering new marketswe’re also doubling the investment in our small business forward initiative to  million over five years to help provide small businesses run by women minorities and veterans get both the capital and technical assistance they need to growwe will also help more families live their dream of owning a home by increasing home lending in low and moderateincome communities by  — to  billion — over the next five yearsto do so we will hire up to  new home lending advisors across our current markets and in some new onesin addition we will increase lending to finance afford able rental housing to  billion over five yearstoday our company is strong and growing and when we grow so do the communities where we do businesswe’re excited to welcome new employees new customers and new communities to jpmorganchase and to look forward to a bright futurehere is some news we announced on how jpmorganchase is immediately putting some of the benefits of tax reform to good work  iipublic policy the need for rational thoughtful consistent tax policythe best longterm tax policy should have the following attributes • the business tax system should be competitive – always – and not be traded off against anything elsei would consider this table stakes for having a healthy economy in the long run • we should build the infrastructure we need we should consider this table stakes too there are many reports that highlight how less expensive it is in the long run to have better infrastructurein fact some studies show it is even more expensive to have bad infrastructure • we should have a progressive tax system helping people on the lower end that progressively taxes higher incomes like mineand of course no one wants to think about their money being misspenttherefore it is critical for washington to show the american public that their money will be used wisely – and that includes canceling or modifying programs that don’t work and not using money to pay off special interest groupsif we need to raise taxes on the more welloff i would hope the more affluent would recognize that they will do better if the country does better • the tax policy should be consistent in the long term for businesses to maximize their productivity and growththis is the best way to permanently drive growth and become a far wealthier and fairer societythere are two things i would do immediately to improve income inequality and create a much healthier society as explained belowwe should reform and expand the earned income tax credit and invest in the workforce of the futurethe earned income tax credit eitc supplements low to moderateincome working individuals and couples particularly with childrenfor example a single mother with two children earning  an hour approx imately  a year could get a tax credit of more than  at year’s enda single male without children also making approx imately  a year does not get any money for a tax credit under this programlast year the eitc program cost the united states about  billion and  million indi viduals received the creditthis program has lifted an estimated  million people above the poverty line the federal poverty guideline is determined by household sizefor a four person household the poverty level is  or approximately  an hour there are some problems with the eitcpaid as a tax credit at the end of the year  of the people who are entitled to it don’t file for it – mostly because they don’t know about itadditionally there is some fraud involvedwe should convert the eitc into more of a negative income payroll tax which would spread the benefit reduce fraud and get it into more people’s hands both democrats and republicans favor a move like this we should also dramatically expand the tax credit and even make it more available to workers without childrenof the  million americans working today approximately  million earn between  an hour the prevailing federal minimum wage and  an hourapproximately  of american workers make less than  an hourit is hard to argue that you can live on  an hour particularly for families even if two are working in that householddecades ago workers with very limited skills could earn a living wage to support themselves and their familyin this new highly technical world – where work skills are so greatly valued – the “natural” wage for unskilled workers may no longer lead to a living wagethis is an area that deserves more study  iipublic policy jobs are a wonderful thingjobs bring dignitythat first job is often the first rung on the ladderpeople like working and studies show that once people start working they continue workingjobs and living wages lead to better social outcomes – more household formation more marriages and children and less crime as well as better health and overall wellbeingas society creates an enormous amount of wealth expanding the eitc would be a very productive way to share itif a large portion of the american population cannot earn a living wage then we will create a situation of permanent social turmoilwe need to improve work skills and training that lead to better jobs — this will help both low and middleincome workersit is also the cure for rapid technological changemany high schools and vocational schools do not provide the education our students need – the ability to graduate and get a decent jobwe should be ringing the alarm bell signaling that inner city schools are failing our children – often minorities and mostly lower income studentsin many inner city schools fewer than  of students graduate and many of those who do are not prepared for employ mentwe are creating generations of citi zens who never had a chance in this land of dreams and equal opportunityunfortunately it’s selfperpetuatingand we all pay the priceaccording to an assessment of math and science scores that the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd conducted in  advanced industrialized countries the united states ranks on averagemaking the investment to improve our performance to the level of the oecd average would increase the us gross domestic product by  over the next  yearsamerica used to be one of the best at training our workforce for good jobswe know what to do to regain that mantlewe need to ensure that our high schools vocational schools tech nical schools and community colleges work together with local businesses to properly train these students so they can get well paying jobs upon graduation then we need to make sure proper apprenticeships and certifications including college credits are widely availablethese students can continue to work or have the opportunity to go back to college if they so choosedoing this well will help the lower skilled and middleincome workers in the new worldthe best way to offset any negatives associated with trade or technology is through continued educa tion and training so that wellpaying jobs are replaced with other wellpaying jobswe know that technological advancements are displacing certain industriesdriverless cars for example are getting closer to mainstream use every daytechnology will bring innova tion but it will also change the employment opportunities available to hundreds of thou sands – perhaps even millions – of peoplewe have the opportunity now to start preparing for and addressing potential future job lossesanticipating problems that may arise from new technologies – and developing plans to responsibly minimize them – should be considered the final phase of our rd processwe as a country must also change the way we think about educationin less mutable times a degree meant that formal learning was completeyou had acquired what you needed for a successful career in your fielda degree in today’s world cannot mean the end of your studiesnew discoveries new advancements new technologies and new terminology all mean that a degree will not carry you as far into the future as it once didwe must place a higher premium on lifelong learningcorporations can do a lot to encourage and foster such a shiftwe should celebrate the benefits of technology and we should also prepare for its challengesoverall technology is the greatest thing that has ever happened to mankindit is the reason why we enjoy our high living standardit is staggering how our lives have changed when compared with  years agowe live longer and work less we are healthier and safer and during that time period billions of people have been pulled out of povertypeople legitimately worry

and work hourswe know technology has been a great force and for the benefit of mankind that force should be left unleashedin the event that it creates change faster in the future than it has in the past – and the economy is unable to adjust jobs fast enough – the best protection is continual workforce training education and reeducation supplemented by income assistance and relocationamerica’s growing fiscal deficit and fixing our entitlement programsamerica’s net debt currently stands at  of gdp this is already historically high but not unprecedentedyou can see in the chart below that the debt level continues to get worse but at an accelerated pace over the ensuing decadeswe have time to fix it so i am not immediately concernedbut this problem will not age well and the sooner we start

little lighter but does not disappear  iipublic policy the real problem with our deficit is the uncontrolled growth of our entitlement programswe cannot fix problems if we don’t acknowl edge themthe extraordinary growth of medicare medicaid and social security is jeopardizing our fiscal situationwe have to attack these issuesi am not going to spend a lot of time talking about social securityi think fixing it is within our grasp – for example by changing the qualification age and means testing among other thingswhen president franklin delano roosevelt astutely put social security in place in  american citizens would work and pay into social security until they were  years oldat that time when someone retired at age  the average life span after retirement was  yearstoday the average person retires at age  and the average life span after retiring is just under  yearsthe core issue underpinning the entitle ments problem is healthcare in the united stateshere are just a few places where we know we can do better • the united states has some of the best healthcare in the world including our doctors nurses hospitals and clinical researchhowever we also have some of the worst – in terms of some outcomes and costs • administrative and fraud costs are esti mated to be  to  of total health care spend • chronic disease accounts for  of spend concentrated on six conditions which in many cases are preventable or reversiblewhile we don’t know the exact fix to this problem we do know the process that will help us fix itwe need to form a bipartisan group of experts whose direct charge is to fix our healthcare systemi am convinced that this can be done and if done properly it will actually improve the outcomes and satisfac tion of all american citizensjpmorganchase along with our partners amazon and berkshire hathaway recently formed a joint venture that we hope will help improve the satisfaction of our health care services for our employees that could be in terms of costs and outcomes and possibly help inform public policy for the countrythe effort will start very small but there is much to do and we are optimisticwe will be hiring a strong management team to start working on some of these critical problems and issues • aligning incentives systemwide – the united states has the highest costs asso ciated with the worst outcomes because we’re getting what we incentivize • studying the extraordinary amount of money spent on waste administration and fraud costs • empowering employees to make better choices and have the best options available by owning their own healthcare data with access to excellent telemedicine options where more consumerdriven health initia tives can help • developing better wellness programs particularly around obesity and smoking – they account for approximately  of chronic diseases eg cancer stroke heart disease and depression • determining why costly and special ized medicine and pharmaceuticals are frequently over and underutilized • examining the extraordinary amount of money spent on endoflife care often unwantedto attack these issues we will be using top management big data virtual tech nology better customer

more regulation so important it is absolutely necessary to have proper regulationoften though we confuse more regulation with good regulationwhat is really needed is smart regulationif you speak with businesses large or small they will give a long list of the time effort and documentation it takes to run their businessthey will show you books of red tape inef ficient outdated systems and extraordinary delaysto start a small business today you need multiple licenseswe have given an example of this with infrastructure in terms of needing up to  years to get a permit to build a bridgeplease read the article on page  written by a very liberal democratic former us senator and presidential candi date about what it was like to run a small businessthe article provides excellent advice for all of our legislators and regula torsunfortunately he learned these lessons only after leaving his career in governmentthe current administration is taking steps to reduce unnecessary regulation by insisting that congressional rules around costbenefit analysis be properly appliedit is also actively trying to put regulators in the right roles with the proper authority to use commonsense principles to make appropriate changesby some estimates approximately  trillion is spent on regulations annually which is about  per householdwhile we believe much of this money is well spent leading to cleaner water and air and safer highways and hospitals for example it is hard to imagine that all of it is well spentdecades of continuously expanding and over lapping regulation certainly can be stream lined and improvedthere is little doubt that excessive regulation has adversely impacted innovation growth and the formation of small businessesthe chart below shows the dramatic reduction in the net formation of small businessesit is hard to know exactly   iipublic policy why this is happening but the main culprits are probably the cost and difficulties that unnecessary regulations cause coupled with the lack of access to credit for new businessesanother study examines the effect poor infrastructure has on efficiency for example poorly constructed highways congested airports with antiquated air traffic control systems aging electrical grids and old water pipesthis could all be costing us more than  billion a yearphilip howard who does some of the best academic work on ameri ca’s infrastructure estimates it would cost  trillion to fix our aging infrastructure – and this is less than it would cost not to fix itpublic company corporate governance — how would you change it and the case against earnings guidancelast year i wrote about the decline in the number of public companies in the united statesunfortunately that trend has continued unabatedindeed if anything it’s acceleratedaccording to one study the number of us public companies has fallen by approximately  over two decades from  in  to  inand that decline it pains me to say is a uniquely american phenomenonpublic company listings in other developed markets have increased over the same periodfortunately policymakers are sitting up and taking noticein a report issued in october  the ustreasury department decried the decline in the number of us public compa nies and recommended several measures to stem the tideeliminating duplicative regu lations liberalizing restrictions on preinitial public offering communications and removing nonmaterial disclosure requirements were some of these measuresjay clayton chairman of the ussecurities and exchange commission also has been quite vocal about the decline he says it potentially deprives “mr and ms k” of the opportunity to participate in much of our country’s wealthy creationi share chairman clayton’s concerntoo many private company owners look at the burdens tied to public company status – among them frivolous shareholder litigation burdensome disclosures that don’t get to the core of investor concerns an unhealthy focus on shortterm results and shareholder meetings that often focus on the trivialbecause of such factors many private compa nies make a rational decision to stay private particularly given rules that increasingly allow individuals to invest in private compa niesultimately that’s not good for america because public companies are a powerful economic engine for job and wealth creationthey are also responsible for onethird of all private sector employment with millions of american families depending on public companies for retirement savings for college and home purchases and investmentso what can public companies do about these issues for one they can continue to engage policymakerssecond they can continue to resist pressures to focus on the short term at the expense of longterm strategy growth and sustainable perfor manceand in my mind quarterly and annual earnings per share guidance is a major contributor to that shortterm focusit can cause companies to hold back on tech nology spending marketing expenditures and other investments in their future in order to meet a prognostication affected by factors outside the company’s control such as fluctuations in commodity prices stock market volatility and even the weatherthat’s why during my time as jpmorganchase’s ceo we’ve never provided quarterly or annual net earnings guidance and why we would support any company that considers dropping such guidance in the futurewe totally support being open and transparent about our financial and operational numbers with our shareholders – this includes providing guidance or expectations around number of branches likely expense levels “what ifs” and other specific items  iipublic policy with their own sizable investment portfolios most public companies could use their power as shareholders to urge public companies and asset managers to take a relentlessly longterm focusof course shareholders of all stripes – and particularly institutional shareholders asset managers as well as asset owners – have a critical role to play in public company corporate governanceamong other things they should exercise their proxy voting rights thoughtfully using independent judgment even where they use proxy advi sors to inform their judgmentthey should actively engage with company boards and management as appropriate to understand the company’s point of view and to convey their ownand they should evaluate and compensate their portfolio managers in a manner that reflects the investment time horizon applicable to the portfolio they are managingthat may mean using perfor mance benchmarks over three five and even year periods in addition to shorter period benchmarksglobal engagement trade and immigration — america’s role in the

the world’s two largest economieswe should acknowledge many of the legitimate complaints around tradetariffs and nontariff barriers to trade are often not fair intellectual property is frequently stolen and the rights to invest in and own companies in some coun tries in many cases are not equalcountries commonly subsidize stateowned enterpriseswhen the us administration talks about “free” and “fair” it essentially means the same on all countsthis is not what has existedit is not unreasonable for the united states to press ahead for more equivalencyin last year’s letter i spoke about nafta and said that while there are some clear problems an updated agreement should be worked out in a way that is fair and bene ficial for all partiesthe logic to do so is completely compellingchina is far more complex – and the complaints are more legitimatechina has realized significant economic and employ ment gains since joining the wto inchina was expected to continue on an aggres sive path of opening up its economy but this has happened at a much slower pace than most nations expectednow more than  years later it has the secondlargest economy in the world and is home to  of the fortune  companies yet it still considers itself a “developing” nation that should not be subject to the same wto standards as the united states and other “developed” coun triesthe chinese government is competent and capable and it has done an extraordi narily good job of managing its emergence as the world’s secondlargest economyi believe  iipublic policy that china understands most of these issues and wants to properly resolve themrecently the united states threatened unilateral action against chinaof course anything that starts to resemble a trade war creates risk and uncer tainty to the global economic systemone of the administration’s best arguments is that negotiation alone has not workedbut regard less of the process here is my view on what the best outcomes would look like • the united states should define very clearly and in detail what it wants from china • the united states should lay out a distinct timeline – and determine what the reaction would be if it is not met • the united states should listen closely to china about any legitimate complaints it may have • this should be done in partnership with our largest allies particularly japan and europe • the united states should revisit the transpacific partnership and fix the parts considered unfairthe tpp could be an excellent economic and strategic agreement between america and its allies particularly asiathis is not against china the country could at some point be offered the oppor tunity to enter the tpp if it demonstrates a willingness to meet its standards which would improve upon the rulesbased global trading system under american leadershipwhile the chance of having an improved trade deal with both mexico and canada as well as a more mutually beneficial relationship with china is possible and preferable there is always a chance that miscalculations on the part of the various actors could lead to nega tive outcomesthis obviously creates higher risk and more uncertainty until resolvedwe need to resolve immigration — it is tearing apart our body politic and damaging our economyimmigration reform is important both morally and economicallyimmigration has been a critical part of america’s economic and cultural vitalityand there are some basic and key principles that most americans seem to agree with • we need to have – and believe that we have – proper border controlamerican citizens have the right to complain that we have not successfully protected our borders since the last immigration reform inin the  amnesty  million undocumented immigrants came forward and now we estimate there are another  million undocumented people domiciled in our countryif the american public does not believe we have proper border control nothing else can be accomplished • the “dreamers” who came to america as undocumented children there are approx imately  million of them should get a path to legal status and citizenship • we need improved meritbased immigra tionthose who get an advanced degree in the united states should receive a green card along with their diplomawe need these skilled individuals in americawe could also improve on other meritbased immigration practices • lawabiding hardworking undocumented immigrants should have a path to legal status or citizenshipthe american public should know this is no easy pathback taxes should be paid and citizenship could take up to  years • finally it is unlikely the american public will feel comfortable with immigration if we don’t revert to some core principlesimmi grants should be coming here because they want to be part of our country and who we are as a peopleamerica was an idea borne of freedom with freedom of speech freedom of religion freedom of enterprise and equality and opportunitypeople immigrating to this country should be taught american history our language and our principlesthe american public will not be proimmigration if we don’t address these issues  closing policy thoughtsit is an absolute necessity that america maintain a worldclass economy with world class companies and a worldclass militarywe need to do a significantly better job of managing our economy if we want it to be world classin closing jamie dimon chairman and chief executive officer april   and finally ceding america’s leadership role on the world stage is a bad idea for everyone – inside and outside our great

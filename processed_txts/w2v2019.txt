customers — consumers small businesses midsize companies large corporations and state and local governmentswe take excellent care of our employeeswe make extraordinary efforts to lift up our communities especially in challenging timeswe are transparent with our shareholders what they should expect regarding our financial and operating performance inwe are working closely with all levels of government during this crisis — and while we will participate in government programs to address the severe economic challenges we will not request any regulatory relief for ourselveswe need a plan to get safely back to workwe need to come together my fervent hope for america  a corporation – essentially any institution – is a living breathing organism made up of people technology institutional knowledge and relationships and is generally organized around mission and purposeentering into a crisis is not the time to figure out what you want to beyou must already be a wellfunctioning organization prepared to rapidly mobilize your resources take your losses and survive another day for the good of all your stakeholdersno matter the challenge we manage our company consistently with principles that have stood the test of timei have written about these inviolable principles often – the need for extremely talented and motivated employees a fortress balance sheet that allows us to invest in good times and in bad times clear comprehensive and accurate financial risk and operating reporting to dealing with an extraordinary crisis let us make quick and accurate decisions a devotion to our customers and communi ties and continuous investing in technology to better serve both our employees and our customers these principles also underlie an organization’s preparedness for tough competition – i was going to write this year that the competition is back in all of its facetsthere’ll be more to come on that next year we are there for our customers employees and communities in good and bad times – we are a port in the stormit is in the toughest of times that we need to use our capital and liquidity to help clients – large and smallcovid is one of those extraor dinary timesbelow are some of the things we are doing to help our company and our customers during this global crisiswe go to extraordinary lengths to help our customers — consumers small businesses midsize companies large corporations and state and local governmentsfirst and foremost we have to be prepared to operate under extremely adverse circumstancesthe significant economic fallout from this crisis reinforces the critical need to keep the global financial system fully functioning – and we recognize that our firm is an important part of the global economytherefore we incorporate plans for resil ience in everything we do – resilience for hurricanes data center failures cyber attacks and other issuesand while we had not envisioned the effects of a pandemic like this one all of this preparation has paid off – and we have been able to accomplish far more and far more quickly than we origi nally thought possibleit is absolutely essential that we be up and functioning for all of our customers each and every dayhow else would we process  trillion in payments or buy and sell approximately  trillion in securities and foreign exchange transactions for our clients on a daily basis and how else would we raise more than  trillion of credit and capital for our clients each year our branches collectively have  million customer visits each day and our combined credit card and debit card transaction volume totals  trillion a yearduring this crisis we have been utilizing our disaster recovery sites and implementing alternative work arrangements globallywe now have more than  employees working from home and quite effectively including traders bankers portfolio managers  dealing with an extraordinary crisis and operations and call center teams across the globewe are ensuring they continue to operate at the highest standards with the proper technological tools and access so they can serve their clients safely and seamlesslyover the past few weeks we have had nearly  concurrent virtual sessions – nearly five times our prepandemic average – and we have capacity in reserve to support signifi cantly more demand if necessarywe’re taking significant steps to help our consumer customersafter superstorm sandy hurricane harvey and other devastating natural disasters around the globe after wildfires ravaged california towns and after a number of other tragic events we stepped up for our customers today we are doing the same across the country as we work individually with customers facing covidrelated hardshipswe have been helping our customers who tell us about their financial struggles as a result of the crisis and are offering relief measures such as • providing a day grace period for mortgage and auto loanlease payments and waiving any associated late fees • removing minimum payment require ments on credit cards and waiving associated late fees • not reporting payment deferrals such as late payments to credit bureaus for upto date clients • continuing to responsibly lend to qualified consumers • waiving or refunding some fees including early withdrawal fees on certificates of deposityou can learn more about our customer response at wwwchasecomstayconnectedof our approximately  chase branches we have managed to keep threequarters of them open – and safe – for our customers who need our servicesin every one of our markets almost all of our  branches with driveup windows have remained open for business allowing people to maintain a safe distanceour  bankers have continued to take appointments and proac tively reach out to customers – helping them manage their finances and use our digital tools – often letting customers stay homein addition the vast majority of our  atms are wellstocked and still functioning to provide needed cash to our customersour call centers have not fared as well many of them have been effectively shut down by local restrictionsas the volume of calls has increased from customers seeking assistance hold times have also increasedwe have mobilized quickly to address this issue reminding customers that our digital selfservice capabilities are always available for them to check balances deposit checks or make paymentsadditionally we have built new tools – digital and electronic – to allow customers to request relief without waiting for a specialistand we are making it possible for our displaced phone specialists to work from homewe are also taking significant action to support businesses — small midsize and large — and state and local governmentsclearly some clients may be much more vulnerable than others – for example trans portation companies hospitality enterprises hospitals utilities and in particular small businesses that do not have enough capital to withstand sudden and sustained down turns in incomejpmorganchase institute research reveals that  of small busi nesses have less than  cash buffer days reinforcing why small businesses are being heavily disrupted by the current crisis and  dealing with an extraordinary crisis will feel the effects for a significant period of time – even as more capital from the recent federal stimulus program reaches themto support businesses during this current crisis we are doing the following • prudently extending credit to businesses of all sizes for working capital and general corporate purposesfor example in the past  days alone we have extended  million in new loans to small businesses • waiving and refunding fees for those businesses in need and finding ways to help more small businesses through resources available at the small business administration • servicing clients with additional credit through revolving facilities when appro priate and stepping in to try to help with credit when others can’t or won’t • continuing in the ordinary course of busi ness to sustain consumers businesses and communities with about  billion of credit and capital raised every quarter • continuing to maintain undrawn revolving commitments in our wholesale businesses which totaled approximately  billion as of the close of business on marchcompanies have already drawn down more than  billion of their revolvers to prepare themselves for the crisis this already dramatically exceeds what happened in the global financial crisismany others have requested addi tional credit which we have been offering judiciously – more than  billion of new credit extensions were approved in the month of march alone • continuing the issuance of bonds for highly rated companies  billion – it may surprise you that the first quarter of  will be our largest quarter for invest ment grade issuance led by jpmorgan • continuing to support vital institutions to keep our communities strong increased funding in march included for example  billion for hospitals and healthcare companies  million for educational institutions  million for nonprofits and  million for state and local governments • continuing to fund construction projects essential to our communities affordable housing food banks and grocery stores through our  billion commitmentrecognizing the extraordinary extension of new credit mentioned above and knowing there will be a major recession mean that we are exposing ourselves to billions of dollars of additional credit losses as we help both consumer and business customers through these difficult times we will provide more detail on these actions later in this letter of course we are in continual contact with our regulators about our actions and effortswe stand ready to assist the government in implementing stimulus package benefits to support the economywe applaud the speed with which the federal government and the federal reserve the fed as well as other central banks around the world put together a stimulus package and other funding benefits to help individ uals businesses and state and local entities across the united states and beyondmuch remains to be done to assure these resources can be quickly and effectively rolled outwe hope to be at the forefront of using this assistance to help our customers get through what is certain to be a difficult next few monthswe will not use this relief funding for ourselves  dealing with an extraordinary crisis times like these reinforce that our employees are our most important asset – they are fundamental to the vibrancy and success of our companyexcellence in everything we do – from operations and technology to service and reputation – depends upon the abilities and character of our employeesour vast and diverse team of people serves our customers and communities builds the technology makes the strategic decisions manages the risks determines our investments and drives innovationsetting aside differing views of our complex world and the risks and oppor tunities ahead it is inarguable that having such an extraordinary team – people with guts brains and enormous capabilities who can navigate whatever circumstances bring – is what ensures our future prosperityin last year’s letter i wrote about the many ways we take excellent care of our employees competitive wages and compen sation k retirement benefits health benefits and wellness programs extensive training programs volunteer and employee engagement opportunities generous parental leave policies and much moreduring this pandemic we have also taken extensive steps to protect and support our employees and their familiesfor example • we continue to pay employees who are at home because they have had potential exposure to the virus or whose health is higher riskadditionally we provide paid medical leave to employees who are unwell • we have clinical staff internally to support our employees through this difficult time whether it is fielding general inquiries related to covid or locating testing or other medical facilities   • all employees are receiving five additional paid days off to help manage personal needs which may include dependent care child care or other issueswe take excellent care of our employees • a special payment of up to  has been granted to full and parttime employees whose job requires them to continue working onsite and generally whose annual cash compensation is less than  • all branch employees are being paid for their regularly scheduled hours even if those hours are reduced or their branch is temporarily closed • for those who must go to work onsite we are reinforcing both basic and enhanced personal and office hygiene measures to keep them their colleagues and their clients safewe have modified business operations staggered shifts changed seating arrangements closed buildings to nonessential visitors and provided addi tional equipment where possiblewe have also intensified nightly and daily cleaning of all offices and branches worldwide that remain openit’s amazing how quickly we have mobilized and implemented workfromhome and other resiliency measures – in weeks instead of months or yearsthere are great lessons to be learned from this experiencewhile conditions may sometimes be unusual and difficult we are functioning smoothlyin fact over the last month in certain parts of our company we’ve had the highest volume and transaction totals we have ever seenneedless to say this success would be impos sible without our exceptional employees and we recognize our responsibility to support both their professional and personal lives now more than ever  a diverse and inclusive company is a stronger company while the health crisis we are facing supersedes all other topics in this year’s letter the subject of diversity and inclusion is such an important one that i feel compelled to include itas a firm we have an unwavering commitment to integrity fairness and responsibilitythat’s why any instances of racist behavior and discrimination are so deeply unsettlingrecently daniel pinto and gordon smith our copresidents and chief operating officers sent a note to employees about steps we’re taking to ensure our values reach all corners of our companydear colleagues we are managing through uncertain times right now and recognize many of you are focusing much of your day on responding to the ongoing spread of the covid coronaviruswhile this is a top priority for all of us we want to make sure you know we haven’t lost sight of our commitment to keeping you informed about our ongoing efforts to strengthen our culturenow more than ever we need the best of everyone because only together will we get through these unprecedented timesas you know after the media reported on alleged discrimination in our firm last year jamie asked gordon to lead an internal team to take a hard look at how we do business so that we could gain a deeper understanding of what more we can do to root out racism and discrimination anywhere it existschallenging our people to be cleareyed and open to change we tasked many of our senior leaders from across the firm from multiple lines of business and control functions to evaluate our policies procedures and programs firmwide to ensure they are fair for all employees and customersto be clear we are looking across the whole firm and at everything we doas a result we’ve identified a number of areas that with enhanced scaled or new programming or processes would serve to improve our culture in important waysfor example we focused on employee and customer complaints — examining common themes where they originated and where opportunity exists to improvewe also looked at how employee discretion may affect product accessibility across lines of businesswe found opportunities to increase awareness about the firm’s diversity  inclusion strategy and we identified a need to expand our diversity recruitment efforts to help us hire more diverse talent and to implement mandatory firmwide trainingwhile this work is ongoing here are five initial areas where work is now underway including enhancing our employee feedback process we are looking hard at how we treat an employee complaint when it comes inwe are already working to simplify escalation channels so employees are clear on where to submit complaints in addition to further building out our capabilities across complaints to better understand the full scope of the individual’s experiencefeedback suggests that employees are not always clear on where to submit complaints so we are working to identify where improvements are neededemployees are encouraged to use existing channels to report inappropriate conduct or discriminationwe will continue to strengthen these “listening posts” and reporting channels in an effort to make sure every one of us feels safe and confident identifying and reporting inappropriate behaviormaking it easier for customers to access products and services we regularly review the products and services we offer to customers and we are looking for ways to boost customer connectivity across our full spectrum of consumer productsto start we are focusing on • enhancing ease of navigating and guiding customers through our full range of products and services available across our entire branch network and • reevaluating the qualification requirements for new product features and benefitswe will improve product parameters and strengthen monitoring tools to ensure the exercise of discretion works as intendedbolstering our hiring systems to build a more robust pipeline of diverse talent attracting the best talent can only be achieved through a dedicated focus on inclusive recruiting so we are recommitting ourselves to this effortwe have made progress in this area with programs such as advancing black leaders a program  focused specifically on increased hiring retention and development of talent from within the black communityover the past four years we have increased the number of black professionals in our most senior ranks with the number of black managing directors and executive directors up by more than  percentin addition we are expanding our specialized team dedicated to conducting more targeted outreach to recruit diverse talentwe will expand on our program to hold hiring managers and recruiters at the highest levels of the company accountable for hiring a diverse group of professionalsinstituting required firmwide diversity  inclusion training in order to drive more diverse and inclusive behaviors amongst our leaders managers employees and customers we are requiring diversity and inclusion training for all employees at various points throughout an employee lifecycle including at the time of hire and periodically thereafterwe expect all employees to fulfill these requirementsbecause the role of the manager is arguably the most critical role in promoting our culture deep into the organization we will make additional manager training mandatory at the time of promotion to a peoplemanager role and at the time of promotion to a senior leader role in addition to other developmental moments for managerswe already have training in many parts of the organization including programs like “journey to inclusive teams” and the required unconscious bias training for branch managerswe will continue to enhance and embed this required training throughout the manager’s careerwe know that it is essential for managers to be inclusive leaders and we will focus on helping them recognize ways they can be intentional about inclusion as they recruit hire retain and develop diverse talentincreasing the diversity of the businesses we partner with firmwide we are fully committed to a fair equitable and inclusive company for our customers our employees our partners and our suppliersthis is part of every manager’s job and they will be held accountablethe diversity of the businesses we partner with across the firm is just as important as our employee diversity — from the small businesses to which we provide access to capital to our asset managers to our suppliers and to the companies we assist in bringing publicwe intend to increase diverse representation through structural process improvements in how we select partners and build our pipelinethe firm will also continue to use data and research to further inform the development of products services employee programs and community investments that help address racial disparities in wealth buildingthis all goes to say our work described above is representative of our deep commitment and is ongoingit is not a “one and done” eventwe will remain steadfast continue to work now and in the future and remain evervigilant in our effort to maintain a culture where racism cannot live or thriveover the next  days each business will review their current strategies and contribute a plan to bring this to life and each business will be held accountablelet us say again we are all the keepers of our culture and we are committed to ensuring that ours is one where all employees and customers are treated equally and fairly and where all of us receive the opportunity and mutual respect we deservei can assure you it did not take one particular story to make us realize that a diverse and inclusive culture is importantwe know that too many people are being left behind – particularly in the black communitythe civil war ended more than  years ago and we still have not come even close to paritywe need to do more as a nation and we have more to do as a firm  dealing with an extraordinary crisiswe make extraordinary efforts to lift up our communities especially in challenging timesi believe that our shareholders know we make extraordinary efforts to lift up our communities both at a local level – supporting schools and work skills training for example – and at the national level helping to formulate policies that are good for countriesthese policies affect healthcare infrastructure education and employment including initiatives such as those that help people with a criminal background get a second chancewe know that crises like covid create further inequities in society so it is even more important that we be present for those communities hit hard by the pandemicjpmorganchase made a  million commitment to help address the immediate humanitarian crisis as well as the longterm economic challenges people facefunding will be deployed over time with particular focus on the most vulnerable people and communities including • immediate healthcare food and other humanitarian relief globally • help for existing nonprofit partners around the world that are responding to the crisis in their communities • assistance to small businesses vulnerable to significant economic hardships in the united states china and europethere is a tremendous amount we do day to day – in addition to traditional banking – to help the communities in which we operate including the following some of which you might be surprised to know • we finance more than  billion in affordable housing each year including residential and commercial lending and mortgages in low and moderateincome communities • we provide small business loans in low and moderateincome neighborhoods • we design products and services to promote the financial health of lower income individuals • we support a number of employee and communitybased initiatives and philan thropic activities including – office of military and veterans affairs which sponsors mentorship devel opment and recognition programs to support the military and veterans working at the firm – women on the move our global firmwide effort that empowers female employees clients and consumers – the service corps which mobilizes employee volunteers to help nonprofit organizations around the world – advancing black pathways a compre hensive program focused on providing more opportunities for black people and blackowned businesses because we know that opportunity is not always created equally – entrepreneurs of color fund which is expanding and provides minority entrepreneurs with access to capital education and other resources • we expect to finance more than  billion in transactions aimed at supporting development in emerging market coun tries – in infrastructure education health care agribusiness and industry among other investments – to promote the united nations’ sustainable development goals  represents managed pretax income  we are adjusting these ccar results for the global market shock trading losses and operational losses — and there have been none in this crisis  dealing with an extraordinary crisis • we are huge supporters of regional and community banks which are critical to many cities and small towns around the countrywe bank approximately  of america’s  regional and commu nity banksin  we lent or raised a total of  billion in capital for themin addition we provide paymentprocessing services for them we finance some of their mortgage activities we advise on acqui sitions and we buy and sell securities for these bankswe also supply interest rate swaps and foreign exchange both for themselves – to help them hedge some of their exposures – and for their clientsforwe are transparent with our shareholders what they should expect regarding our financial and operating performance in  example while many community banks were seeking more liquidity to serve their local communities amidst covid fears we were able to help approximately  community banks secure  million in increased cash availability over a three week period in march delivering  billion of cash to support their branches and atmsthis is not only a win for our clients but also for the communities in which they operateof course we do not know how this crisis will ultimately end including how long it will last how much economic damage it will do or how fast or slow the recovery will bewe have always been serious about stress testing and run an enormous number of tests per week so that we are prepared for most crisesbut as is often the case this “actual new crisis” – while it shares attributes with what is being stress tested – is dramatically different from the expectedwe stopped buying back our stock we have always held the position that the highest and best use of our equity is to reinvest it in our own business and of course to be able to withstand tough timeshalting buybacks was simply a very prudent action – we don’t know exactly what the future will hold – but at a minimum we assume that it will include a bad recession combined with some kind of financial stress similar to the global financial crisis ofour bank cannot be immune to the effects of this kind of stresswe will share in detail our latest thinking on the impact this crisis will have on our finan cials in our first quarter earnings release in midapril however to put it in context here is how our shareholders can think broadly about a reasonable range of outcomesour  pretax earnings were  billion – a huge and powerful earnings stream that enables us to absorb the loss of revenues and the higher credit costs that inevitably follow a crisisfor comparison the comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar results for  that we submitted to the federal reserve in  which assumed outcomes like us unemployment peaking at  and the stock market falling  showed a decline in revenue of almost  and credit costs of approximately  billion more than what we experienced inwe believe we would perform better than this if the fed’s scenario were to actually occurbut even in the fed’s scenario we would be profitable in every quarter these stress test results also show that following such a meaningful reduction in our revenue and assuming we continue to pay dividends our common equity tier  cet ratio would likely hold at a very strong  and we would have in excess of  billion of liquid assetsadditionally we have run an extremely adverse scenario that assumes an even deeper contraction of gross domestic product down as much as  in the second quarter and lasting through the end  dealing with an extraordinary crisis of the year and with us unemployment continuing to increase peaking at  in the fourth quartereven under this scenario the company would still end the year with strong liquidity and a cet ratio of approx imately  common equity tier  capital would still total  billionthis scenario is quite severe and we hope unlikelyif it were to play out the board would likely consider suspending the dividend even though it is a rather small claim on our equity capital baseif the board suspended the dividend it would be out of extreme prudence and based upon continued uncertainty over what the next few years will bringit is also important to be aware that in both our central case scenario for  results and in our extremely adverse scenario we are lending – currently or plan to do so – an additional  billion for our clients’ needsdespite this our capital resources and liquidity are very strong in both modelswe have over  billion in total liquid assets and an incremental  billion borrowing capacity at the federal reserve and federal home loan banks if needed to support these loans as well as meet our liquidity requirements these numbers do not include the potential use of some of the fed’s newly created facilitieswe could of course make our capital and liquidity buffer better by restricting our activities but we do not intend to do that – our clients need usi would like to point out that as we get closer to the extremely adverse scenario current regulatory constraints will limit additional actions we can take to help clients – in spite of the extraordinary amount of capital and liquidity we could deploywe are working closely with all levels of government during this crisis — and while we will participate in government programs to address the severe economic challenges we will not request any regulatory relief for ourselveswe are just beginning to analyze and work with the government on all of their various programsfor the most part these initiatives will need the deep involvement of the private sector to be properly executedwe intend to do everything we can – and as soon as possible – to ensure that government support is reaching the people who need it mostwe applaud and support the recent actions the usdepartment of the treasury and the federal reserve have taken to try to miti gate the economic impact of the covid turmoil the fed’s overwhelming actions have already dramatically reduced the financial stress in the system and there is still more they could do if they need tofor example balance sheet expansion additional lending facilities and changes to capital and liquidity requirements are steps designed to ensure that more capital will flow through the system which will ultimately allow us to help more families and small businessesthese actions would bolster the us economy with no impact on safety soundness or regulatory oversightwe are working with the govern ment to make sure such crisisrelief measures are structured to work effectively – there are a significant number of details that need to be resolved which i will not go into herewhile we will aggressively help our customers take advantage of these new programs though we must take action to protect ourselves from ongoing – and more important future – litigation risk we want our shareholders to know that we have not requested any regulatory relief for ourselvessaying that we will not ask for regulatory relief does not mean the government shouldn’t change some rules and regulations howeverfor example some rules can improperly prevent healthy wellcapitalized banks from lending freely in times of stressthis can hurt customers as the crisis deepensleaving highquality available liquidity undeployed in times of need is an opportunity forever lost  dealing with an extraordinary crisis i have written in detail in past letters that the regulatory system is in need of both reform and recalibration – not because we want it to happen but because it would be good for a deepening and widening of the financial system – something that would benefit all americanswhile a lot of the rules were constructive and made the financial system stronger we are now seeing the impact of poorly coordinated poorly cali brated and poorly organized rulemakingafter the crisis subsides and it will our country should thoroughly review all aspects of our preparedness and responseand we should use the opportunity to closely review the economic response and determine whether any additional regulatory changes are warranted to improve our financial and economic systemthere will be a time and place for that – but not nowwe need a plan to get safely back to workit is hoped that the number of new covid cases will decrease soon and – coupled with greatly enhanced medical capabilities more beds proper equipment where it is needed adequate testing – the healthcare system is equipped to take care of all americans both minimizing their suffering and maximizing their chance of livingonce this occurs people can carefully start going back to work of course with proper social distancing vigilant hygiene proper testing and other precautionsthere are many jobs that can be safely done however employees in certain companies should return to business as usual only if the centers for disease control and prevention cdc and other government entities deem it safe to do soin addition this “return to work” process could be accelerated if federal state and local governments make tests widely available that allow people to certify that they have contracted and recovered from the disease have the necessary antibodies to prevent them from getting sick again and are not infectious to anyoneinitially we need a buffer period of days or weeks for people to be tested and then for those who test negative for the virus we need to discover whether virus antibodies appear through serology testing both the cdc and private companies are scrambling to produce such tests the uk has ordered  million of them germany will use them to issue immunity certificates to covid survi vors and china and singapore already are using tests to determine how extensively the virus spread in large populations in order to measure the true infection ratein the united states the food and drug admin istration is allowing doctors to use these serology tests to identify recovered patients whose antibodies could treat emergency cases of the diseasethe country was not adequately prepared for this pandemic – however we can and should be more prepared for what comes nextdone right a disciplined transition would maxi mize the health of americans and minimize the time extent and suffering caused by the economic downturn  dealing with an extraordinary crisis sometimes extraordinary events in history can cause a change in the body politicas a nation we were clearly not equipped for this global pandemic and the consequences have been devastatingbut it is forcing us to work together and it is improving civility and reminding us that we all live on one planete pluribus unumi am hoping that civility humanity empathy and the goal of improving america will break throughwe have the resources to emerge from this crisis as a stronger countryamerica is still the most prosperous nation the world has ever seenwe are blessed with the natural gifts of land all the food water and energy we need the atlantic and pacific oceans as natural borders and wonderful neighbors in canada and mexicoand we are blessed with the extraordinary gifts from our founding fathers which are still unequaled freedom of speech freedom of religion freedom of enterprise and the promise of equality and opportunitythese gifts have led to the most dynamic economy the world has ever seen – one that nurtures vibrant businesses large and small exceptional universities and a welcoming environment for innovation science and technologyamerica was an idea borne on principles not based upon histor ical relationships and tribal politicsit has and will continue to be a beacon of hope for the world and a magnet for the world’s best and brightestof course america has always had its flawsthe current pandemic is only one example of the bad planning and management that have hurt our country our inner city schools don’t graduate half of their students and don’t give our children an education that leads to a livelihood our healthcare system is increasingly costly with many of our citi zens lacking any access and nutrition and personal health aren’t even being taught at many schoolsobesity has become a national scourgewe have a litigation and regulatory system that cripples small businesses with red tape and bureaucracy ineffective infra structure planning and investment and huge waste and inefficiency at both the state and federal levelswe have failed to put proper immigration policies in place our social safety nets are poorly designed and the share of wages for the bottom  of americans has effectively been going downwe need to acknowledge these problems and the damage they have done if we are ever going to fix themthere should have been a pandemic play booklikewise every problem i noted above should have detailed and nonpartisan solu tionsas we have seen in past crises of this magnitude there will come a time when we will look back and it will be clear how we – at all levels of society government business healthcare systems and civic and humani tarian organizations – could have been and will be better prepared to face emergencies of this scalewhile the inclination of some will be to fingerpoint and look for blame i hope we can avoid thati also hope we can avoid people using times of crisis to argue for what they already believewe need to demand more of ourselves and our leaders if we want to prevent or mitigate these disastersthis can be a moment when we all come together and recognize our shared responsibility acting in a way that reflects the best of all of usas president kennedy historically said “ask not what your country can do for you – ask what you can do for your country” my fervent hope is that america rolls up its sleeves and starts to attack these problemsfixing them would better prepare us for future catastrophes create better economic outcomes for everyone with policies that aim to maximize economic growth driving the best potential outcomes improve income inequality protect the most vulner able and foster economic growth that is more resilient which would also strengthen america’s role in the worldwe must neverwe need to come together my fervent hope for america  dealing with an extraordinary crisis forget that america’s economic prosperity is a necessary foundation for our military capability which keeps us free and strong and is essential to world peacethese issues could all be tackled while preserving the freedoms ascribed by our founding fathers life liberty and the pursuit of happiness freedom of speech freedom of religion and freedom of enterprise which means the free movement of capital and labor meaning you can work where you want and for whom you wantat the end of the day the pursuit of happiness our freedoms and free enterprise are inseparableif we acknowledge our problems and work together we can lift up those who need help and society as a wholebusiness and govern ment collaborating together can conquer our biggest challengeswhile i have a deep and abiding faith in the united states of america and its extraordinary resiliency and capabilities we do not have a divine right to successour challenges are significant and we should not assume they will take care of themselveslet us all do what we can

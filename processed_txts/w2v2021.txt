jamie dimon chairman and chief executive officer dear fellow shareholders we are facing challenges at every turn a pandemic unprecedented government actions a strong recovery after a sharp and deep global recession a highly polarized us election mounting inflation a war in ukraine and dramatic economic sanctions against russiawhile all this turmoil has serious ramifica tions on our company its effect on the world — with the extreme suffering of the ukrainian people and the potential restructuring of the global order — is far more importantadding to the disruption these events are unfolding while america remains divided within its borders with many arguing that it has lost its essential leader ship role outside of its borders and around the worldbut during this difficult time we have a moment to put aside our differences offer solutions and work with others in the western world to come together in defense of democracy and  essential freedoms including free enterprisewe have seen america in partner ship with other countries around the globe come together previously during instances of conflict and crisisthis juncture is also a moment when our country needs to work across the private and public sectors to lead once again by among other remediations improving american competitiveness and better ful filling equal access to opportunity for alljpmorganchase a company that has historically worked across borders and boundaries will do its part to ensure the global economy is safe and securei discuss these themes later in this letteralthough i begin this annual letter to shareholders in a challenging landscape i remain proud of what our company and our hundreds of thousands of employ ees around the world have achieved collectively and individuallyas you know we have long championed the essential role of banking in a community — its potential for bringing people together for enabling companies and individuals to reach for their dreams and for being a source of strength in difficult timesthroughout these past two challenging years we never stopped doing all the things we should be doing to serve our clients and our communitieslooking back on the last year and the past two decades — starting from my time as ceo of bank one in  — it is clear that our financial discipline constant investment in innovation and ongoing development of our people are what enabled us to persevere in our steadfast dedication to help clients communities and countries throughout the world  was another strong year for jpmorganchase with the firm generating record revenue as well as setting numerous other records in each of our lines of businesswe earned  billion in net income on revenue of  billion versus  billion on revenue of  billion in  reflecting strong underlying performance across our businessesincluded in the  billion is  billion after tax in reserve releases due to the volatility introduced by the new current expected credit loss accounting  standardwe have pointed out repeatedly that we do not consider these reserve releases core or recurring profits because they are driven by hypothetical probabilityweighted scenariosexcluding these reserve releases we still earned  on tangible equity — an extremely healthy numberwe generally grew mar ket share across our businesses and continued to make significant investments in products people and technology all while maintaining credit discipline and a fortress balance sheetin total we extended credit and raised capital of  trillion for large and small businesses governments and us consumersi’d like to note some steadfast principles that are worth repeatingthe first is that while jpmorganchase stock is owned by large institutions pension plans mutual funds and directly by individual investors in almost all cases the ultimate beneficiaries are individuals in our communitiesmore than  million people in the united states own stock and a large percentage of these individuals in one way or another own jpmorganchase stockmany of these people are veterans teachers police officers firefighters healthcare workers retirees or those saving for a home education or retirementyour management team goes to work every day recognizing the enormous responsibility that we have to our shareholderssecond while we don’t run the company worrying about the stock price in the short run in the long run our stock price is a measure of the progress we have made over the yearsthis progress is a function of continual investments in our people systems and products in good and bad times to build our capabili tieswhether looking back  years or since the jpmorganchasebank one merger in  these investments have resulted in our stock’s significant out performance of the standard  poor’s  index and the standard

company — from maintaining a fortress bal ance sheet constantly investing and nurturing talent to fully satisfying regula tors continually improving risk governance and controls and serving customers and clients while lifting up communities worldwideif you look deeper you will find that our success and accomplishments are founded on our commitment to our shareholdersshareholder value can be built only if you maintain a healthy and vibrant company which means doing a good job taking care of your customers employees and communitiesconversely how can you have a healthy company if you neglect any of these stakeholders as we have learned in  there are myriad ways an institution can demonstrate its compassion for its employees and its communities while still upholding shareholder valueadhering to our basic principles and strategies allows us to drive good organic growth and properly manage our capital including dividends and stock buy backs as we have consistently demonstrated over the past decadesall of this is shown in the charts on pages  which illustrate how we have grown our  franchises how we compare with our competitors and how we look at our fortress balance sheeti invite you to peruse them at your leisurein addition i urge you to read the ceo letters in this annual report which will give you more specific details about our businesses and our plans for the futurethere are two other critical points i would like to makewe strive to build endur ing businesses and we are not a conglomerate — all our businesses rely on and benefit from each otherboth of these factors help generate our superior returnsbut despite our best efforts the moats that protect this company are not particularly deep — and we face extraordinary competitioni have written about this reality extensively in the past and cover it in more detail in this letterhowever it is the hand we have been dealt and we will play it as best we canmy friend warren buffett spoke in his letter this year about his silent partner — the us government — noting that all his company’s success is predicated upon the extraordinary conditions our country createshe is right to say to his share holders that when they see the flag they should all say thank youwe should tooi do just want to note that in our case the silent partner is not so silentjpmorganchase is a healthy and thriving company and we always want to give back and pay our fair sharewe do — and we want it to be spent well and have the greatest impactto give you an idea of where our taxes and fees go in the last  years we paid  billion in federal state and local taxes in the united states and  billion in taxes outside of the united stateswe also paid the federal deposit insurance corporation  billion so that it has the resources to cover the failure of any major american bankfinally the basis of our success is our peoplethey are the ones who serve our customers and communities build the technology make the strategic decisions manage the risks determine our investments and drive innovationwhatever your view is of the world’s complexity and the risks and opportunities ahead having a great team of people — with guts

fueled by the dramatic upswing in consumer spending and the shift in that spend from services to goodsfortunately during these two years vaccines for covid were also rap idly developed and distributedin today’s economy the consumer is in excellent financial shape on average with leverage among the lowest on record excellent mortgage underwriting even though we’ve had home price appreciation plentiful jobs with wage increases and more than  trillion in excess savings mostly due to government stimulusmost con sumers and companies and states are still flush with the money generated in  and  with consumer spending over the last several months  above precovid levels but we must rec ognize that the account balances in lowerincome households smaller to begin with are going down faster and that income for those house holds is not keeping pace with rising inflation today’s economic landscape is completely differ ent from the  financial crisis when the con sumer was extraordinarily overleveraged as was the financial system as a whole — from banks and investment banks to shadow banks hedge funds private equity fannie mae and many other enti tiesin addition home price appreciation fed by bad underwriting and leverage in the mortgage system led to excessive speculation which was missed by virtually everyone — eventually leading to nearly  trillion in actual lossesduring  and  many aberrant things also happened  million people retired early the sup ply of immigrant workers dropped by  million due to immigration policies available jobs sky rocketed to  million again unprecedented and job seekers dropped to  millionwage growth accelerated dramatically particularly in low income jobswe should not be unhappy that wages are going up — and that workers have america and the rest of the world are facing the confluence of three important and conflicting forces  a strong us economy which we hope has covid in its rearview mirror  high inflation which means rising interest rates and importantly the reversal of quantitative easing qe and  the war in ukraine and the accompa nying humanitarian crisis with its impact on the global economy in the short term as well as its significant impact on the geopolitics of the futurethese factors will likely have a meaningful effect on the economy over the next few years and on geopolitics for the next several decadesi should remind the reader that we normally don’t worry about — or even try to predict — normal fluc tuations of the economyin all times we are pre pared for difficult markets and severe recessions as well as for unpredictable events not only so we will survive them but also so we can be there for our clients when they need us the mosthowever sometimes there are powerful underlying struc tural trends that we must try to understand since their impact can be so large with widespread impact on many parts of human existencethe useconomy is strongin  and  enormous qe — approximately  trillion or  of  gross domestic product gdp — and enormous fiscal stimulus which has been and always will be inflationary — approximately  trillion or  of  gdp — stabilized markets and allowed companies to raise enormous amounts of capitalin addition this infusion of capital saved many small busi nesses and put more than  trillion in the hands of consumers and almost  trillion into state and local coffersthese actions led to a rapid decline in unemployment dropping from  to under  in  months — the magnitude and speed of which were both unprecedentedadditionally the economy grew  in  despite the arrival of the delta and omicron vari  significant geopolitical and economic challenges more choices and are making different decisions — in spite of the fact that this causes some diffi culties for businesshouse prices surged during the pandemic housing became and still is in extremely short supply and asset prices remained high some in my view in bubble terri toryinflation soared to  while clearly some of this rise is transitory due to supply chain short ages some is not because higher wages higher housing costs and higher energy and commodity prices will persist more to come on this laterall these factors will continue in  driving further growth as well as continued inflationone additional point consumer confidence and con sumer spending have diverged dramatically with consumer confidence droppingspending how ever is more important and the drop in con sumer confidence may be in reaction to ongoing fatigue from the pandemic shutdown and con cerns over high inflationpersistent inflation will require rising interest rates and a massive but necessary shift from quantitative easing to quantitative tighteningit is easy to secondguess complex decisions after the factthe federal reserve the fed and the government did the right thing by taking bold dramatic actions following the misfortune unleashed by the pandemicin hindsight it workedbut also in hindsight the medicine fiscal spending and qe was probably too much and lasted too longi do not envy the fed for what it must do next the stronger the recovery the higher the rates that follow i believe that this could be signifi cantly higher than the markets expect and the stronger the quantitative tightening qtif the fed gets it just right we can have years of growth and inflation will eventually start to recedein any event this process will cause lots of consternation and very volatile marketsthe fed should not worry about volatile markets unless they affect the actual economya strong economy trumps market volatilitythis is in no way traditional fed tightening — and there are no models that can even remotely give us the answersi have always been critical of people’s excessive reliance on models — since they don’t capture major catalysts such as cul ture character and technological advancesand in our current situation the fed needs to deal with things it has never dealt with before and are impossible to model including supply chain issues sanctions war and a reversal of qe in the face of unparalleled inflationobviously the fed always needs to be datadependent and this is true today more than ever beforehowever the data will likely continue to be inconsistent and volatile — and hard to readthe fed should strive for consistency but not when it’s impossible to achieveone thing the fed should do and seems to have done is to exempt themselves — give themselves ultimate flexibility — from the pattern of raising rates by only  basis points and doing so on a regular scheduleand while they may announce how they intend to reduce the fed balance sheet they should be free to change this plan on a moment’s notice in order to deal with actual events in the economy and the marketsa fed that reacts strongly to data and events in real time will ultimately create more confidencein any case rates will need to go up substantiallythe fed has a hard job to do so let’s all wish them the bestthe shift from qe to qt will cause a massive change in the flow of funds in and out of treasury bonds and therefore all securitiesour situation today is completely unlike the monetary policy adjustments following the great financial crisis ofwhen central banks were buying bonds from  to  there was a tremendous amount of deleveraging in the rest of the finan cial worldclearly this deleveraging slowed growth which in turn reduced the need for busi ness investmentin addition banks were required to buy treasuries to meet their new liquidity requirementsthis action reduced both lending and the money supply in the years after the great financial crisislow growth also led to less capital needed and qe added to the savings gluti am  significant geopolitical and economic challenges as i write this letter the war in ukraine has been raging for well over a month and is creating a sig nificant refugee crisiswe do not know what its outcome ultimately will be but the hostilities in ukraine and the sanctions on russia are already having a substantial economic impactthey have roiled global oil commodity and agricultural mar ketswe expect the fallout from the war and resulting sanctions to reduce russia’s gdp by  by midyear a decline worse than the  drop after the  defaultour economists cur rently think that the euro area highly dependent on russia for oil and gas will see gdp growth of roughly  in  instead of the elevated  pace we had expected just six weeks agoby con trast they expect the us economy to advance roughly  versus a previously estimatedbut i caution that these estimates are based upon a fairly static view of the war in ukraine and the sanctions now in placemany more sanctions could be added — which could dramatically and unpredictably increase their effectalong with the unpredictability of war itself and the uncertainty surrounding global commodity supply chains this makes for a poten tially explosive situationi speak later about the precarious nature of the global energy supply but for now simply that supply is easy to disrupt we should also keep in mind that as a percent age of global gdp oil is only about  of what it was in  — but it is still essential and critical the confluence of these factors may be unprecedentedeach of these three factors mentioned above is unique in its own right the dramatic stimulus fueled recovery from the covid pandemic the likely need for rapidly raising rates and the required reversal of qe and the war in ukraine and the sanctions on russiathey present com pletely different circumstances than what we’ve experienced in the past — and their confluence may dramatically increase the risks ahead still convinced that these are some of the primary reasons our economy experienced low growth and socalled “secular stagnation” in today’s economic environment countries’ cen tral banks do not need to increase their foreign exchange reserves as they did after the great financial crisis and banks don’t need to buy trea suries to improve their liquidity ratiosthis time around business investment will likely be higher both because of higher growth and because the capital required to combat climate change is esti mated to be more than  trillion annuallyfinally governments will also need to borrow more money — not lessthis massive change in the flow of funds trig gered by fed tightening is certain to have market and economic effects that will be studied for decades to comeour bank is prepared for drasti cally higher rates and more volatile marketsthe war in ukraine and the sanctions on russia at a minimum will slow the global economy — and it could easily get worsethe effects of geopolitics on the economy are harder to predictfor as much attention as it gets geopolitics over the past  years have rarely disrupted the global economy in the short run think afghanistan iraq korea vietnam con flicts between pakistan and india india and china china and vietnam russia and china and at least  other upheavals and wars in the mid dle eastthe  organization of the petroleum exporting countries or opec oil embargo was an exception when the sharp jump in oil prices pushed the world into a global recessionhow ever it’s important to point out that while past geopolitical events often did not have shortterm economic effects they frequently had large longerterm consequences — such as america’s experience with the vietnam war which drove the great inflation of the s and s and tore the body politic apart  significant geopolitical and economic challenges while it is possible and hopeful that all of these events will have peaceful resolutions we should prepare for the potential negative outcomesin the next section i discuss immediate actions we should take to protect us from potential seri ous problemsthe war could affect geopolitics for decadesrussian aggression is having another dramatic and important result it is coalescing the demo cratic western world — across europe and the north atlantic treaty organization nato coun tries to australia japan and koreathe united states and the west realize there is no replace ment for strong allies and strong militariesthe war and prior trade disputes with china also highlight the critical importance of economic relationships and trade particularly trade that involves anything affecting national securitythe outcome of these two issues will transcend russia and likely will affect geopolitics for decades potentially leading to both a realignment of alli ances and a restructuring of global tradehow the west comports itself and whether the west can maintain its unity will likely determine the future global order and shape america’s and its allies’ important relationship with china which i talk more about later in this letterhow are we managing our global bank in these difficult markets and complex times our hearts go out to all of those affected by the war — jpmorganchase and its employees have already donated over  million to the ukrainian humanitarian crisis with more to comejpmorganchase has also played its part in the implementation of the western world’s policies and sanctions regarding russiaof course we are following both the letter of the law and the spirit of all the american and allied sanctions working hand in hand with governments to implement complex policies and directives and then somemanaging this has been an enormous undertak ingit is completely different from navigating a financial crisis or a severe recessionthis entails sanctioning individuals including their ownership of assets and companies reducing exposures across multiple products and services analyzing and stopping billions of dollars of payments as directed by governments and many other actionswe are not worried about our direct exposure to russia though we could still lose about  billion over timebut we are actively monitoring the impact of ongoing sanctions and russia’s response concerned as well about their second ary and collateral effects on so many companies and countrieswe have been steadfast in our operating principles to be prepared for the unpredictablerest assured that our manage ment teams hundreds of us globally have been working around the clock to do the right thing  significant geopolitical and economic challenges the extraordinary need for strong american leadership even before the war in ukraine jeopardized the world order we were facing exceptional and enormous global challenges — nuclear prolifera tion this is still the biggest risk to mankind bar none and made all the more stark by the war in ukraine threats to cybersecurity terrorism climate change pressures on free and fair trade and vast inequities in societycritical to solving these problems is strong american leadershipamerican global leadership is the best course for the world and for america — and our leadership needs to articulate to its citizens why this is the casethe war in ukraine reminds us that in a troubled world national security always becomes the paramount concernwe should never again forget that this is true even in peace ful times — and we should never again be lulled into a false sense of securitypower abhors a vacuum and it should be increasingly clear to all that without strong american leadership chaos likely will prevailthe world does not want an arrogant america tell ing everyone what to do but instead wants amer ica working with allies collaborating and compro misingmost of the world would applaud mature respectful and civil leadership by americawe can organize military and economic frameworks that make the world safe and prosperous for democ racy and freedom only if we work with our alliesif western allies across europe and asia realize there is power in strong partnership it puts the western world in a better position to address future challenges including those posed by china’s growththis is applicable to areas where we have common interests eg antiterrorism nuclear proliferation climate change as well as to areas where we may not eg economic and political competitionit also is clear that trade and supply chains where they affect matters of national security need to be restructuredyou simply cannot rely on coun tries with different strategic interests for critical goods and servicessuch reorganization does not need to be a disaster or decouplingwith thought ful analysis and execution it should be rational and orderlythis is in everyone’s best interestwhile america has flaws its essential strengths enduremany feel despondent about the “decline” of americaour economy has had anemic growth for decadescovid and george floyd’s murder cast a spotlight on what we already knew — that our lowerincome citizens often minorities suffer more in our society particularly during reces sions and times of turmoilcontinuing income inequality may very well be causing growing par tisanship as some people believe the american dream is fraying and that our system is unfair leaving many of our citizens behindin prior letters i have detailed our poor manage ment of basic policy in america and what the consequences have been from that dysfunction ineffective education systems soaring healthcare costs excessive regulation and bureaucracy the inability to plan and build

untrained and unpre pared labor force excessive student debt and the lack of proper federal government budgeting and spending which lead to huge inefficienciessince i have covered these issues at length in the past i will not elaborate on them herei do however want to point out and i find it disheartening how readily we accept the failure often with a chuckle of our bureaucracy and policiesour country is not perfect but our basic princi ples — ie the rule of law individual liberties freedom of speech and religion and the concept of equal opportunity — are still exceptional ideals that most of the world wants yet often is not able to achievethese principles still make america  the extraordinary need for strong american leadership the partner of choice for many countries and the destination of choice for many individualsour american system gave us one of the world’s most prosperous and innovative economiesi do not like it when anyone disparages this wonderful country because of our flawsthough our sins may be real they are the sins of all countrieswe can celebrate this country for having given so much to so many while acknowledging prior mis takes and fixing themit is shocking to me how many people denigrate not just america but free enterprise and the essential role of businessif america could open its borders to all i have little doubt that billions of people if they could would want to come here and few would leaveamerica has faced tough times before — the civil war world war i the us stock market crash of  and the great depression that followed world war ii and  among othersas recently as the late s and s we struggled with the loss of the vietnam war political and racial injustice recessions and inflation do you remember america’s obsession and fear about the emergence of japan as an economic power in the s in each case however america’s resiliency persevered and ultimately strength ened our position in the worldwe hope this time is no different but we should not be complacent as we do not have a divine right to successto maintain our competitiveness our country must regain its competence — and our principles including free enterprise need to be nurturedamerica’s moral economic and military might all derive from our principles and are also predi cated on the strength and competence of the american systemwe must acknowledge that nurturing and maintaining our enormously pros perous economy provides the foundation of that systemultimately that economy is what pays for the best military the world has ever seenover the past  years our economy has grown on average at onlyamerican ingenuity work ethic technology and business capability were able to overcome some — but not all — of our mismanagementwe should not accept mediocrity we no longer imagine what should be over the past decade we should have grown atfreedom and its brother free enterprise properly regulated are the answer — not unconstrained capitalism nor crony capitalism where business uses government and regula tions to maintain its position or strengthen its handall interest groups business groups included should applaud good public policy and not resist it for selfserving reasonsfree enterprise celebrates and is inseparable from human freedom and creativity which ulti mately are the sources of all human progressthe secret sauce of free enterprise is not only the free movement of capital but also more importantly the value of knowledge and free people exercising their rightsnonetheless many countries — inadvertently through decades of following bad policy or delib erately by restricting freedoms — damage the full benefit of free enterprise and often discourage savings innovation and the free movement of people and laborwe all believe in great social safety nets that reduce poverty provide opportu nity for good jobs and serve as an engine for economic growthbut freedom slowly disappears when a country’s government controls too much of its economy and people in nearly every coun try free or not do not like constantly being told what to doit is disingenuous when political lead ers say that government “built the roads” and then use that statement as an argument to sup press free enterprisethe roads were built by the people and for the people so that all could travel and prosperwhat we really need are free enterprise more civicminded companies and citizens and extraor dinarily competent government and policies  the extraordinary need for strong american leadership government with its unique powers has an essential role in managing the economy — but it needs to be realistic about its limitations on what it can and cannot dowe have fallen into the rut of false narratives which distracts us from facing realitywe don’t define our problems properlyif you have the wrong diagnosis of a problem you will certainly have the wrong solutioneven if you have the right diagnosis you still may arrive at the wrong solution — but your odds are certainly much betterour policies are often incomprehensible and uncoordinated and our policy decisions frequently have no forethought and no identifica tion of desired outcomeswe sometimes blame inflation on corporate prof its — for example the cost of meat in the united states is high not because of the profits earned by the meat packing industry but because of high cattle and feed costs and disruptions in logisticssimilarly energy costs are high not because of price gouging but because of the dramatic decline in investments in energy which results in reduced supply when demand goes upregulation has dra matically impeded our ability to build good infra structure in a timely manner — the cost of building a highway has more than tripled in  years purely because of expenses due to regulationsour politics are dysfunctional which has prevented some of our best brightest and most competent to want to work in governmentwhile we have plenty of economists academics and lifetime pol iticians in government who i know are committed to doing their best we need additional brain power capabilities and experience from leaders across all sectors of our society including busi nessit is going to take extraordinary broad based leadership to solve our problemsthere are some things only the federal govern ment can do — among them protect national security operate federal courts act as a central bank perform certain research and development rd and execute some national infrastructurewhile government cannot create jobs outside of government itself it can optimize the conditions under which jobs can be createdif it simply exhibits consistency and competence in the per formance of its tasks government will maximize investments and jobsconversely government can destroy jobs and capital investment through bureaucracy red tape and constant policy changesgovernment cannot and will not be able to hold back technology but it can foster an envi ronment that promotes quick retraining of those who are replaced by technological advancementsour problems are neither democratic nor republican — nor are the solutionsunfortunately however partisan politics are preventing collaborative policy from being designed and implemented particularly at the federal levelwe would do better if we listened to one anotherdemocrats should acknowledge republicans’ legitimate concerns that money sent to washing ton often ends up in large wasteful programs ultimately offering little value to local communi tiesdemocrats could acknowledge that while we need good government it is not the answer to everythingdemocrats could also acknowledge that a healthy fear of a large central government is not irrational like a leviathanrepublicans need to acknowledge that america can and should afford to provide a proper safety net for our elderly our sick and our poor as well as help create an environment that generates more opportunities and more income for more americansrepublicans could acknowledge that if the government can demonstrate that it is spend ing money wisely we should spend more — think infrastructure and education fundingand that may very well mean higher taxes for the wealthyshould that happen the wealthy should keep in mind that if tax monies improve our society and our economy then those same individuals will be in effect among the main beneficiariesdemocrats and republicans often seem to be ships passing in the night — with both parties talking at cross purposes even when they may share the same goalscompromise is not incom patible with democracy — in fact compromise is  the extraordinary need for strong american leadership a core principle of democracyenacting major policies on a purely partisan basis think health care and tax reform virtually guarantees decades of fightingit’s not unreasonable to assert that major policies should be bipartisan or not at allwe must remember that the concepts of free enterprise rugged individualism and entrepre neurship are not incompatible with meaningful safety nets and the desire to lift up our disadvan taged citizenswe can acknowledge the excep tional history of america and also acknowledge our flaws which need redresswe must confront the russia challenge with bold solutionsamerica must be ready for the possibility of an extended war in ukraine with unpredictable out comeswe should prepare for the worst and hope for the bestwe must look at this as a wakeup callwe need to pursue shortterm and longterm strategies with the goal of not only solving the current crisis but also maintaining the longterm unity of the newly strengthened democratic alli anceswe need to make this a permanent long lasting stand for democratic ideals and against all forms of evilour nation’s solutions need to be bold brave and dynamic — and they have to be bipartisan — because we know only bipartisan solutions stand on firm groundbipartisanship could start with the appointment of republicans to the cabinetwe need to think broadly because whatever we do will not only help determine the fate of the war in ukraine but likely will determine the ability of the western democratic world to address critical future challengeswe also need to ensure that the western coalition remains economically com petitive on the world stagethe better america performs as a country in dealing with russia now the easier it will be for us to engage with the rest of the world including china going forwardin addition to being big cleareyed and realistic our solutions should acknowledge that we are essentially and unfortunately reverting to some cold war strategieshere are some actions we should take immediately • demonstrate leadership and commitment to a longterm military strategy by meaningfully increasing our military budget and troop deployment on nato’s borders as appropriateto both sides these steps make our resolve clear and reflect our recognition of the grave new geopolitical realities • direct billions of dollars in aid to ukraine announced now to support the country currently and to help rebuild in the futurewe should also help the europeans with the enormous migration issues they are facingthe united states could take the lead in humanitarian efforts and ask all nations including china to join us in this response • turn up sanctions — there are many more that could be imposed — in whatever way national security experts recommend to maximize the right outcomes • we need a “marshall plan” to ensure energy security for us and our european alliesour european allies who are highly dependent on russian energy require our helpfor such a plan to succeed we need to secure proper energy supplies immediately for the next few years which can be done while reducing co emissionsas we are seeing — and know from past experience — oil and gas supply can be easily disrupted either physically or by additional sanctions significantly impacting energy pricesnational security demands energy security for ourselves and for our allies over seasfortunately we do not need to change our longterm objectives on climate change and greenhouse gases and we should remind ourselves that using gas to diminish coal con sumption is an actionable way to reduce co emissions expeditiouslywhile the united states is fairly energy independent we need to increase our energy production and get more gas in the form of liquefied natural gas to europe immediatelyour work with all of our allies should include urging them to both  the extraordinary need for strong american leadership increase their production and deliver some of it to europeto do this we also need immedi ate approval for additional oil leases and gas pipelines as well as permits for green energy projects ie solar and windwe cannot accomplish our goals with misguided and counterproductive policiesstrong bold and comprehensive shortterm and longterm policies persistently and properly exe cuted will maximize the strength and the durable unity of the democratic worldnot only will this be very good for the western world in general but it will help frame our approach with chinaa strong america need not fear a rising chinathe most important relationship over the next  years will be the one between america and its allies and chinathe stronger the allied nations the better it is for americabut for america to get this essential relationship right we need to have a cleareyed view of our strategic economic and national security interestsamerica is not operating from a position of weak ness indeed our strengths are extraordinaryconversely over the next  years china will have to grapple with some serious issues for all of its strengths china still needs more food water and energy to support its population pollution is ram pant corruption continues to be a problem state owned enterprises are often inefficient corporate and government debt levels are growing rapidly financial markets lack depth transparency and adequate rule of law income inequality remains highly prevalent and its working age population has been declining sincechina will continue to face

geopolitically speakingmany of china’s neighbors afghani stan india indonesia japan korea pakistan the philippines russia and vietnam are large com plicated and not always friendly to china — in fact china has had border skirmishes and wars with india the soviet union and vietnam since world war iithese neighbors do not all look at the rise of china as being completely beneficialby comparison america is at peace with its north american neighbors and is protected by the atlantic and pacific oceansamerica and china have large differences ideo logical democracy versus singleparty rule and market capitalism versus statecontrolled capital ismwe also have common interests halting nuclear proliferation reducing terrorism stop ping climate change and promoting peaceful rela tionshipsall countries including china want to lift up their peopledone right we can establish and maintain a relationship with china that will allow both countries and the world to thrivebecause we are dealing with a combination of cir cumstances that we have never confronted before — the rise of a country equal in size to us unfair trade and bilateral investment rights and state sponsored subsidies and competition — we will need to respond in equally unprecedented wayswe should stop complaining about unfair prac tices and just take appropriate actionboth coun tries can take unilateral actions as they see fit in the economic domain — and they already do — and that is okayto counter unfair competition on china’s part ie subsidies and statesponsored monopolies we will need to develop thoughtful policies and strategies that workwe also need to develop “industrial policies” that help industries impor tant to national security for example semicon ductors g rare earths and others succeedi believe this could be done intelligently and not as “handouts” or subsidies that create excessive profitsthis will also require increased govern ment rd focused on activities that business simply cannot do alone — advanced science military technologies among othersalthough there will be global trade restructuring lots of global trade and trade with china will remain even after trade partnerships have been alteredkeep in mind china’s trade with the west and the united states in  totaled  trillion  the extraordinary need for strong american leadership exports and importsby contrast china’s total trade with russia in  totaled almost  billionclearly these economic relationships are critical to china and the west — china also has a huge interest in making this workall of these policies must be done in conjunction with our allies or they will not be effective — because without a united front unfair economic and trade practices will still be allowed to flour ishif it were up to me i would rejoin the trans pacific partnership tppwe need to look at trade as only one part of strategic economic part nerships — and that’s exactly what tpp didthere is a lot at stake but there is no reason why seri ous comprehensive honest negotiations can’t lead to good outcomesthere are compelling reasons for global trade restructuringthere is no question that supply chains need to be restructured for three different reasons • for any products or materials that are essential for national security think rare earths g and semiconductors the us supply chain must either be domestic or open only to completely friendly allieswe cannot and should not ever be reliant on processes that can and will be used against us especially when we are most vulnerable • for similar national security reasons activities including investment activities that help create a national security risk — ie sharing critical technology with potential adversaries — should be restricted • companies will diversify their supply chains simply to be more resilientthis restructuring will likely take place over time and does not need to be extraordinarily disrup tivethere will be winners and losers — some of the main beneficiaries will be brazil canada mexico and friendly southeast asian nationsalong with reconfiguring our supply chains we must create new trading systems with our alliesas mentioned above my preference would be to rejoin the tpp — it is the best geostrategic and trade arrangement possible with allied nationswe can have a path forward for uspolicy agree on what we want then executewe need more real leaders — people who know how to get things done who are capable and who can educate and explain to all citizens what we need and whywe need a renaissance of the american dream and american “cando” exceptionalismour leaders need to agree on what we want and then execute to get it doneat a minimum we should all agree that we want • the world’s most prosperous economy which would also mean having the world’s reserve currencythe strength and the importance of the us dollar are predicated on the strength and openness of the us economy the rule of law and the free movement of capital • regulations and policies that foster growth and accomplish stated goals but don’t cripple busi ness innovation and investmentpolicies need to be consistent reliable and constantly reviewed to reduce red tape and increase efficiency • a new strategic economic and competitive framework devised in partnership with our allies particularly as it relates to china which includes trade and industrial policy as previ ously discussedthis does need rebrandingtrade is only part of an economic relationship there are investment rights property rights education immigration rights and so onwe should always negotiate strategic economic agreements remembering that whether you emerge with a formal agreement or not you likely have created a policy • a “marshall plan” as previously mentioned to ensure energy security for us and our euro pean allies requiring us to secure proper energy supplies immediately for the next few years which can be done while reducing co emissions and combatting climate change  the extraordinary need for strong american leadership learning from other countries’ successes – and failures it is always instructive to look around the world at policies and countries that work — and policies and countries that don’t workfor example you can find countries that have done a great job pro viding safety nets — without damaging labor — and building infrastructure efficiently without crippling regulationsa number of countries have succeeded in developing themselves surprisingly often with minimal natural resources ireland israel singapore south korea and swedensingapore has developed effective healthcare programsgermany and switzerland have created impressive work apprenticeship models and hong kong has excelled at infrastructureanother inspiring example is irelandafter decades of sectarian strife and terrorism ireland is now a melting pot with a thriving economy due to good government policiesthen there are the counterexamples countries sometimes flush with natural resources — argen tina cuba and venezuelararely is the successful nation the socialist or autocratic oneand all of the negative cases are either socialist govern ments or governments hypothetically run in the name of the peoplethe successful nations on the other hand all are marketbased economies of slightly different types with policies that grow their economy and share the nation’s wealthsweden is a good example of a country that many consider socialist but it is far from itby most measures sweden is actually more of a market based economy than the united states and it has enormous wealth and extremely strong social safety nets • the strongest military in the world — continu ally maintained though used judiciously and in conjunction with our alliesthe strength of the military needs to be matched by the strength of our diplomatic development and intelligence agencies • a more equitable labor market that maximizes employment and values all jobs effective and continuous job training for workers of all ages and practices that better promote sharing the wealth — ie higher minimum wages an increased earned income tax credit eitc broader healthcare coverage and other related policies • a strong america that respects all its citizens helps the poor and disadvantaged honors again the dignity of work and demonstrates character and civilityand we all want well functioning healthy social safety netsthe war in ukraine and the growing competitive ness of china — including its growing military and strategic alliances across the globe — dictate that we move forward on our comprehensive needsif we do not resolve our problems and restore effective longterm leadership it is easy to envi sion darker days ahead in both the economic and geopolitical realmsbut with great leadership america our allies and the rest of the world will enjoy a brighter future  the extraordinary need for strong american leadership competitive threat redux the growing competition to banks from each other shadow banks fintechs and large technol ogy companies is intensifying and clearly contrib uting to the diminishing role of banks and public companies in the united states and the global financial systembefore we give an update on the structural shifts taking place it would be good to address the question how did banks perform during the recent covid crisis banks performed magnificently during the covid crisiswithin days of realizing covid was a pandemic that would virtually close large parts of the world’s economies the us government moved with unprecedented speedfortunately most banks were part of the solution — unlike during the great recession when many banks were notand fortunately unlike during the great reces sion the us economy was actually in good shape going into the covid recessionyes of course it is true that large government actions dramatically helped individuals compa nies including banks and the economy overallbut it is also true that banks performed magnifi cently during the covid crisisthey extended a huge amount of credit waived fees and post poned debt repayment and were at the forefront of delivering paycheck protection program ppp loans to small businessesand they did it the right way protecting government money by trying to make legitimate loans to borrowers in needby contrast nonbanks were involved in instances of illegitimate ppp loans and economic injury disaster loan assistance as well as stimu lus money fraud often at rates almost five times those of traditional banksas for us • jpmorganchase was the  ppp lender — over the life of the program we funded more than  loans totaling over  billion • since march   we delayed payments due and refunded fees for more than  million customer accounts — refunding more than  million for nearly  million consumer deposit and lending accounts and offering delayed payments and forbearance on more than  million mortgage auto and credit card accounts representing approximately  billion in loans • in  we raised capital and provided credit totaling  trillion for customers and busi nesses of all sizes helping them meet payroll avoid layoffs and fund operations during that first year of the pandemic crisis • in  we committed  million in global business and philanthropic initiatives with particular focus on the people and communi ties most vulnerable and hardest hit by the pandemic • in addition jpmorganchase launched several ambitious flagship programs including our  billion commitment to help close the racial wealth gap and drive economic inclusion which is described in more detail within this letterwhile the us government’s actions were a ben efit to the whole economy including the banking industry banks were more than able to weather the terrible financial storm while setting aside extensive reserves for potential future loan lossesimportantly during this time the fed con ducted two additional severely adverse compre hensive capital analysis and review stress tests which projected bank results under extreme unemployment gdp loss market disruption and a smaller

scenario — the methodol ogy clearly does not result in an accurate forecast of how our company would perform under adverse circumstancesthe role of banks in the global financial system is diminishingbanks have advantages and disadvantagessome of the advantages including economies of scale profitability and brand may only diminish slowlyunfortunately it also seems likely that some of the disadvantages such as uneven or costly regu lation may not diminish at allother disadvan tages like legacy systems will diminish over timeregulations have consequences both intended and unintended — but many regulations are crafted with little regard for their interplay with other policies and their cumulative effectas a result regulations often are disconnected from their likely outcomesthis is particularly true when trying to determine what products and ser vices will remain inside the regulatory system as opposed to those likely to move outside of itkeep in mind that markets not regulators set capital requirementsif regulators set capital standards that are too high for banks to hold loans then the markets will drive those loans outside of the banking systemthere are also noncapital regulatory standards that can force activities out of the regulatory system such as excessive reporting and social requirements among othersbanks around the world are already engaged in tough competition with each othera quick review of the chart on page  shows the phenomenal size of nonbanks — from payments companies and fintechs to exchanges and big tech — that com pete with

chart on page  shows banks’ decreasing role in the global economy but a few examples will put it in stark contrast • banks’ size and market cap us global systemically important bank gsib market cap is  trillion have dramatically dimin ished relative to their nonbank competitors • us banks’ brokerdealer inventories have barely kept pace with the large increase in total marketsbanks’ dramatic decline in market making ability relative to the size of the public markets is a factor in the periodic disruptions that occur in the public markets • us banks’ loans in an year period have only grown  and now represent only  of total us debt and equity markets down from  in  • conversely us banks’ liquid assets are up more than  to  trillion most of which is needed to meet liquidity requirements • banks’ share of mortgage originations has gone from  to  • banks’ share of the leveraged loan market has decreased over the last  years from  to  • neobanks now with over  million accounts bypass the durbin amendment and so earn higher revenue per debit swipe — and they don’t have to abide by certain other regulatory or social requirements • other companies providing bankingtype services have hundreds of millions of accounts that hold consumer money process payments access bank accounts and extensively use customer data • a sizable and growing portion of equity trading has moved off transparent exchanges to non traditional trading firms causing a loss of access to onexchange liquidity for many market participantsi can go on and on but suffice it to say we must be prepared for this trend to continueit seems unlikely to me that all the banks shadow banks and fintech companies will thrive as they strive to take share from each other over the next decadei would expect to see many mergers among america’s  banks — they need to do this in some cases to create more economies of scale to be able to competeother companies will try differ ent strategies including bankfintech mergers or mergers just between fintechsyou should expect to see some winners and lots of casualties — it’s just not possible for everyone to perform wellpossibly more important the role of public companies in the global financial system is also diminishingin addition to banks’ shrinking global role you can see that the number of public companies which should have grown substantially over the past decade is remarkably reducedinstead us public companies peaked in  at  and now totalconversely the number of pri vate us companies backed by private equity companies has grown from  to  — a remarkable increasethis migration is worthy of serious studythe reasons are complex and may include public mar ket factors such as onerous reporting require ments higher litigation expenses costly regula tions cookiecutter board governance less com pensation flexibility heightened public scrutiny and the relentless pressure of quarterly earningsit’s incumbent upon us to figure out why so many companies and so much capital are being moved out of transparent public markets to less trans parent private markets — and whether this is in the country’s longterm interestwe do need to ask some questions do we want public compa nies are we okay with more and more of our capital markets being private and therefore less regulated if i were a shareholder of a company i would ask myself do i really think that all the rules we impose on public companies actually make them better finally we need to consider is it a good thing that many investors won’t have the opportunity to invest in these companies if and when they are private  competitive threat redux there are good and bad reasons why capital is going privatefor example private companies can raise money more easily now than in the pastprivate companies’ boards and manage ment teams can focus primarily on the business and private investors can be more patient with capital — they are not necessarily worried about shortterm resultswe need to study this public market diminishment thoughtfully and deeply — particularly since more regulation is coming that will affect this trendthis is a good time to think through and create the outcomes we want — and not just let multiple often wellmeaning but uncoordinated legal reg ulatory and policy decisions take us where we do not want to gomore regulation is coming —  years after the crisis we are still rolling out basel iv — and we need more thoughtful calibration of the rulesbasel iv seems likely to increase capital require ments for banks on credit loans trading books and operational risk some of which is unneces sarythese risks are real but they need to be properly and rationally calculatedfor example operational risk is real it exists in all enterprises and is usually handled in the ordinary course of businessif all large companies had to hold capi tal for operational risk following the standard set for banks trillions of dollars of additional capital would be permanently held in idle fundsthe question for all capital requirements is how much is enough if done properly bank regulations could be recali brated adding virtually no additional risk to make it easier for banks to make loans interme diate markets and finance the economywhen it comes to political debate about banking regula tions there is little truth to the notion that regu lations have been “loosened” — at least in the context of large bankswe should keep in mind the enormous unintended consequences that could result from any policy eg regulations not being properly thought throughpolicy with no forethought — designed without a comprehensive plan or instigated out of anger or false morality — can have bad outcomesa few examples will suffice • the us government management of student lending has been a disasterin the  years since they’ve taken over student lending they have extended an additional  trillion in loansprior to the pandemic  billion of these loans were either severely delinquent or not being paidwe are not against student lending but the disciplined use of capital should be applied here tooi generally agree with the position that for loans that should not have been made and where the borrower reaped no benefit there should be some forgivenesshowever many loans were properly made and brought the benefit that was expectedgovern ment should reform its policies to stop making loans that should never be made • fannie mae and freddie mac contributed to the crisis in the mortgage marketin the mad rush to improve home ownership levels these gov ernmentguaranteed institutions played a major part along with many others engaged in the mortgage markets over decades in loos ening mortgage underwriting standardsulti mately this proved catastrophic leading to nearly

and simplenot only have american rules made the gsib designation worse for american banks if jpmorganchase could operate on the same basis as large european banks our tier  capital requirements would be reduced by  billion but the rules have not been adjusted as the framework allowsgsib capital requirements were supposed to be modified to account for the increasing size of the global economy and the smaller size of banks in relation to that global economy — this simply has not happenedso jpmorganchase will be required to hold  more common equity tier  capital as a consequencewe have always said that the gsib calculation is nonsensical as it is not riskbased at allit drives absurd behavior such as favoring various acquisi tions that may be imprudent but don’t require gsib capital or encouraging very risky loans that require no more gsib capital than riskfree loansbeing a large diversified company with strong revenue and profit streams is normally a source of strength in troubled times but this is a negative in regard to gsib capitaleven though american banks are performing well today these extra capital requirements we are required to meet will have longterm negative consequencesthis extra capital is a drag on our return on equity roe effectively reducing whatever our roe would be by approximately  hypothetically our  target should beas a result the dilemma is this do we restrict our growth and our ability to serve our clients in order to reduce our capital requirements over time and seek a higher roe or do we invest our capital to grow with our clients and in many cases remain competitive and accept a permanently lower roe banks need to acknowledge the dramatically changing competitive landscapeif banks want to compete in this new and increas ingly competitive world they need to acknowl edge the truth of this new landscape and respond appropriately — sometimes it truly is change or dieas they adopt new technologies like cloud artifi cial intelligence ai and digital platforms banks may have an advantage in being able to leverage their large customer base to offer increasingly comprehensive products and services often at no additional costwhile many fintech companies specialize in one area you already see many fin techs moving in this direction — trying to deepen and broaden their client relationshipsthe chart on the preceding page

future and that is even more true today than it has been in the pastbut the principle is the same — constantly invest and innovate to ensure our future prosperity  competitive threat redux investments and acquisitions determining the best use of capital and assessing rois we have always said that a steady and increasing dividend along with reinvestment in one’s own business — organically and inorganically offen sively and defensively — are the highest and best use of capitalreinvestment would ordinarily come before stock buybacks unless the stock is extraordinarily cheapand we generally only buy back stock when we don’t see a clear need for the capital over the next few yearsin fact stock buybacks at our company will be lower in the next year or so because we may need to retain more capital due to required capital increases which by any real measure we defi nitely do not need and because we have made some good acquisitions that we believe will enhance the future of our companywe try to be rigorous in how we invest for the futureabove all we try to free up our capital and capabilities with the following in mind  we reduce complexity in our company and simplify as much as possible  we periodically assess and eliminate hobbies which have a dan ger all their own and  we assess investments and activities that seemed good when we started them but are not working out as plannedhow ever some things simply are complex like air planes pharmaceuticals technology and bank ing but worthwhile — and in fact necessary to competewe don’t let fear of that complexity stop us from investingbefore we talk about different types of invest ments we should recognize that our most impor tant asset — far more important than capital — is the quality of our peoplewe announced earlier in the year that our total expenses would increase by approximately  billionof that amount  billion is mostly related to people reflecting both inflationary and competitive labor market dynamics we have been quite adamant that we will do what is neces sary to retain talent — we cannot be one of the best companies without having some of the best talent included in this  billion are certain expenses think travel and entertainment as economies have reopenedin this section of the letter i am going to focus on investments — describing how and why we do them and offering a few exampleswe have always believed that investing continuously and rigorously for the future is critical for our ongoing successthis year we announced that the expenses related to investments would increase from  billion to  billioni am going to try to describe the “incremental investments” of  billion though i can’t review them all and for competitive reasons i wouldn’tbut we hope a few examples will give you comfort in our decisionmaking processsome investments generate predictable returnssome investments have a fairly predictable time to cash flow positive and a good and predictable return on investment roi however you measure itthese investments include branches and bank ers around the world across all our businessesthey also include certain marketing expenses which have a known and quantifiable returnthis category combined will add  billion to our expenses in   investments and acquisitions determining the best use of capital and assessing rois our shareholders should also know that when we make investments like these we incorporate throughthecycle thinking — we don’t only look at current margins and chargeoffs but also eval uate what we expect them to be over the next several yearsacquisitions should pay for themselves — and each one has its own logicacquisitions generally extend products add ser vices or bring in technology that we would have had to otherwise build ourselvesthese acquisi tions are described in more detail in the letters from the other ceos included in this reportover the last  months we spent nearly  billion on acquisitions which will increase “incremental investment” expenses by approximately  million inwe expect most of these acquisitions to produce positive returns and strong earnings within a few years fully justifying their costin a few cases these acquisitions earn money — plus we believe help stave off erosion in other parts of our busi nessimportantly on an ongoing basis many of our acquisitions will be relatively capitallite meaning they can grow over time but require little additional regulatory capitalwe want to build upon our global footprintwhile we don’t disclose our investment here our international consumer expansion is an invest ment of a different naturewe believe the digital world gives us an opportunity to build a con sumer bank outside the united states that over time can become very competitive — an option that does not exist in the physical worldwe start with several advantages that we believe will get stronger over time a global brand with longterm capital and staying power a global payments business an international private bank global asset management products and bestinclass trading platformswe have the talent and knowhow to deliver these through cuttingedge technology allowing us to harness the full range of these capabilities from all our businesseswe can apply what we have learned in our leading us franchise and vice versawe may be wrong on this one but i like our handwe make extensive investments in technology for a broad range of reasons from improving operations and security to enhancing our products and servicesinvestments in technology and operations as well as related products and services are the most complicated categorysome of these invest ments simply must be done to sustain the compa ny’s healthinvestments in this bucket help keep the ship in tiptop shape and touch a broad range of workplace needs regulatory requirements and necessary improvements for cybersecurity as well as operational resiliency and securitysome things we have done with no direct revenue ben efit rather simply to maintain our competitive positioni call these table stakes — think of digital account opening for consumer and small business accountsother investments are specific improvements to products and services often with identifiable benefitsfinally there are specific investments in this category that are more like forwardlooking rd as described in the examples that followcombined this category will add a little bit less than  billion to our “incremental investment” expenses in  the actual expense lines could be for people hardware or software or pur chased servicesalmost all of the  billion in expenses are analyzed and studied for their roi or other significant benefitssometimes people refer to some of these expenses as modernizing or adopting new tech nologiesi prefer not to talk about it that way because effectively we have been modernizing my entire lifealso the term implies that once you get to a modern platform these expenses should dramatically decrease — which is rarely  investments and acquisitions determining the best use of capital and assessing rois the casein fact when we analyze these expenses we incorporate not only the cost to build the product or service but also the cost to maintain it going forwardfurthermore once you have built the new platforms they generally cre ate a whole new set of investment opportunities to be analyzedtechnology always drives change but now the waves of technological innovation come in faster and fasterthe science behind them is also increasingly complex as technology including ai is “embedded” in more productsin today’s world i cannot overemphasize the importance of implementing new technologywe hope a few examples will explain how these expenses are managedto do so we are going to talk about two different types of investments that are clearly related infrastructure and softwarefirst on the path to new and modern infrastruc ture cloudbased systems whether private or public will ultimately be faster cheaper more flexible and also aienabled — all extremely valuable featuresa few other additional details • we have spent  billion building new cloud based data centersour total expensed cost of data centers is higher than in previous years — mostly because of the duplicative expense that is generated as we run both the new and older centers • thousands of applications and their related databases are being replatformed and refac tored to run in the private and public cloud envi ronmentto give you an example we migrated our card mainframe to the new data center and are already seeing approximately  faster response times for our major customerfacing applicationsthis one application will use only  of the capacity of our new data centers of our more than  applications that will still be in use in two years  will have been replatformed • these “infrastructure” costs include things like modernizing developer tools and embedding operational resiliency and cybersecurity controlssecond much of our “incremental investment” technology spend involves building software for new products and servicesthere are hundreds of these large and smallagain a few examples will describe the process • in certain product areas we made large multi year investments to improve a specific busi nessin payments we have been investing con sistently over the past five years to modernize our businesses and compete with both banks and fintech companiessince  we have invested more than  billion in technology operations sales products and controls and generated an incremental  billion in organic revenue annually taking our overall market share in treasury services from  in  to  inin  we continued this strong momentum initiating a large majority of all realtime payments in the united states in our cloudnative faster payments platform which is now live in  countrieswe are also winning more than  of all global bids that include virtual account solutions available on our liquidity platformwe now process payments for eight of the top  global big tech companies up from three out of  companies five years ago consis tently winning business from strong competi torswe continue to bring to the market and commercialize innovative products such as embedded banking aidriven fraud controls and forecasting and account validation and programmable payments on jpm coindecen tralized finance and blockchain are real new technologies that can be deployed in both pub lic and private fashion permissioned or notjpmorganchase is at the forefront of this inno vationwe use a blockchain network called liink to enable banks to share complex infor mation and we also use a blockchain to move tokenized us dollar deposits with jpm coinwe believe there are many uses where a block chain can replace or improve contracts data ownership and other enhancements for some purposes however it is currently too expensive or too slow to be deployed  investments and acquisitions determining the best use of capital and assessing rois we expect to achieve doubledigit market share over time in payments being the world’s most innovative bank as well as the safest and most resilient • we built the capability for our selfdirected investing which now has  new invest ment accounts totaling nearly  billion on the platformwe are excited to enhance and roll out this product to all of our customers as we think it is a critical offering in today’s new competitive environment • increasingly we are investing more money think hundreds of millions of dollars each year on ai for very specific purposesfor example we use ai to generate insights on existing and prospective clients from public information such as kyc protocols regulatory filings social media news public websites and documentsonce standardized the information is then applied to multiple uses such as generating leads identifying companies and investors onboarding clients and detecting environmen tal social and governance esg themesin all of these cases there are identifiable returns due to lower prospecting costs or improved servicesone specific example will suffice — in the consumer world we have spent about  million since  on ai machine learning and other technology initiatives to improve fraud risk systemswe know this investment is workingour annual fraud losses have come down  since  despite volumes being up almost  and we estimate that our technology investments alone have contributed about  million in annual savings • we have developed over  application pro gramming interfaces that give various types of customers access to our systems in a controlled way allowing them to automate our banking systems into their enterprise systems • there are plenty of forwardlooking and exciting rd investments toofor example we are working on several researchbased projects that have the potential for significant future impactthese involve multiagent simulation synthetic data and encryption methods — elements that have the capacity to unlock new ways of trading managing risk and assessing productivitymulti agent simulations for example enable the exploration of strategies that can handle chal lenging regimes as variations of novel historical datasynthetic data wellcalibrated by real data enables effective testing experimentation and development without triggering privacy and regulatory restrictions associated with using real dataencryption methods give us better tools to protect our clients’ privacy and also equip us with the necessary techniques to handle the metaversethis category also includes investment in the critical area of quantum computingwhile we measure each of these incremental investments and there are hundreds of them as diligently as we can you can assess the overall results by asking the following questions do we maintain the competitiveness of our products are we gaining market share do we have real wins against some tough competitors both in the bank ing world and in fintech companies what are our customer satisfaction scores have we built won derful new products like credit journey and self directed investing that may not generate revenue but clearly have improved our business how are our products serving our clients’ needs to access our systems how and when they want finally also consider is the bank sustaining its overall competitive position growing at pace and still maintaining a very healthy return on tangible common equity while investing for the future we hope you will see some great new and exciting products and services this year  investments and acquisitions determining the best use of capital and assessing rois updates on specific issues facing our company we are vigilant against cyber attacksas we have highlighted in previous letters we cannot overemphasize how cyber threats pose extreme hazards to our company and our countrythis has become even more evident as the cost of ransomware has increased dramatically cyber attacks may have caused the death of some peo ple as hospitals could not provide the necessary proceduresand it is evident to everyone with the war in ukraine that grave damage could be inflicted if cyber is widely used as a tool of warwe believe that our company has some of the best cyber protections in place as well as the best talent to monitor and guard our informationwe also work extensively and increasingly with the appropriate agencies of the us government to help protect the financial system and the countryour commitment to sustainability is informed by energy realitiesdespite the growth in wellintended climate pledges from governments and companies the world is well short of meeting its net zero emis sions goals bybut the war in ukraine and sanctions on russia are driving gasoline prices up and threatening europe’s access to natural gasresource scarcity leads to higher energy costs and reduces reliability hindering national security and hurting the most vulnerabledisruptions to the global energy system are again highlighting our urgent global need to provide energy resources securely reliably and affordably and at the same time address longterm clean energy solutions and strategies to reduce our carbon footprintthese objectives are not mutually exclusivewe can — and must — do bothto begin we need to find a better way forward that can bring diverse stakeholders together in pursuit of the north star another “marshall plan” as described earlierhere are four ways to jumpstart that process • first we must promote energy securitycon straining the flow of capital needed to produce and move fuels especially as the war in ukraine rages on is a bad ideathe world still needs oil and natural gas today but not all hydrocarbons are equal when it comes to their carbon foot printwe should be directing more capital toward less carbonintensive fuel sources and investing in innovations such as carbon capture and sequestration as we look to transition to green technologies delivered at scale for soci etyour company is firmly committed to helping finance these kinds of investments and expedit ing the use of lowercarbon fuelsthis is why we established the center for carbon transition centralizing client access to financing advisory and research solutions to help them make the lowcarbon transition and thrive • second we need to scale investment massively in clean technologiesas the international energy agency has emphasized “huge leaps in clean energy innovation” are core to achieving net zerothis is because the world will rely on traditional fuels until alternatives like clean hydrogen are fully availableto accelerate progress jpmorganchase has a goal of financ ing and facilitating  trillion by  to advance climate action — supporting initiatives such as renewable energy green buildings and vehicle electrification • third governments should play a leadership role by enacting thoughtful policies that spur longterm and largescale capital deployment for lowcarbon solutions that create jobs and benefit the global economyhere are some examples a carbon tax that directs some pro ceeds to help offset energy costs for under  updates on specific issues facing our company served communities measures to promote investment in technology rd and reductions in permitting timelines for energy infrastruc ture such as wind and solar farms and lique fied natural gas • finally let’s set meaningful goals and identify a few tangible costeffective solutions to reduce emissions todaythis should include minimizing fugitive methane emissions and virtually elimi nating wasteful flaring of natural gasimmedi ately actionable opportunities like these might require more financing not less to reduce the shortterm rate of climate change and prepare companies to thrive in a lowercarbon futurein  jpmorganchase set  targets to reduce the carbon intensity of our financing portfolio starting with oil and gas electric power and automotive manufacturing — with more to comethere is no silver bullet to meet the world’s energy and climate goalsbut we can start by pri oritizing emissions reductions developing mean ingful short and longterm goals and crafting innovative policy solutionsthe curve toward net zero can still be bent before it’s too lateprogress continues in our diversity equity and inclusion effortswe’ve made tremendous progress over the past few years to create a more inclusive company and promote equity in all our communitiesthe work is not easy but we are as committed as ever to doing what is right and justi’ll spotlight a few areas of focus and describe the progress we’ve madea more diverse workforce we continue to believe that if our team is more diverse we will generate better ideas and better outcomes enjoy a stronger corporate culture and outperform our competitorsthis appears to be proving truedespite the pandemic and talent retention chal lenges we continue to boost our representation among women and people of colorhere are some examples • more women were promoted to the position of managing director in  than ever before similarly a record number of women were promoted to executive directorby year’s end based on employees who selfidentified women represented  of the firm’s total workforceoverall hispanic representation was  asian representation grew to  and black representation increased to  • we expanded our global diversity equity and inclusion department to include three new centers of excellence advancing hispanics and latinos the office of asian and pacific islander affairs and the office of lgbt affairs • to promote greater participation in our work force by black professionals we expanded our historically black colleges and universities partnerships to  schools across the united states to boost recruitment connections expand student career pathways and support longterm student development and financial health • we continue to find ways to lift our lgbt employees professionals with disabilities and military veteran colleagueswe just celebrated the th anniversary of the veteran jobs mission which is a coalition jpmorganchase cofounded in  as the  jobs missionit began as  companies committed to hiring military talent across the private sector and now membership exceeds  companies with more than  veterans hiredfinally i want to be clear we oppose any and all forms of discrimination against anyonebeing the bank of choice for all is our goal — and we want everyone to feel welcome here and be able to contribute to our core mission to the best of their ability  updates on specific issues facing our company an update on our  billion racial equity commitment the murder of george floyd in  highlighted what we already knew more was required by all of us to address systemic racismin october  less than five months after his tragic mur der our company made a fiveyear  billion commitment to help close the racial wealth gapwe committed to trying new things and putting the full force of our firm behind solutions that could really make an impactby the end of  we had deployed or commit ted more than  billion toward our goalthat commitment focuses on increasing homeowner ship expanding affordable rental housing and growing small businesses spending more with black hispanic and latino suppliers improving financial health and access to banking investing in minority depository institutions mdi and com munity development financial institutions cdfi and investing in communities through philan thropic capitalhere are some details on our progress to date • supplier diversity in  we spent an addi tional  million with  black hispanic and latino suppliers — more than doubling the first year spend goal and increasing the number of new black hispanic and latino suppliers by more than  over  • affordable rental housing we approved funding of approximately  billion in loans to create and preserve more than  affordable housing and rental units across the united states • homeownership we established a community and affordable home lending business hiring over  community home lending advisors and expanding the chase homebuyer grant to  to help cover customers’ closing costs and down payments for homes purchased in  minority neighborhoods nationwide • small business we hired  diverse senior business consultants to provide free oneon one coaching for minority business owners in  us cities and to mentor more than  small businesses • mdis we invested more than  million in equity in  diverse financial institutions that serve nearly  communities in  states and the district of columbia • cdfis we provided more than  million in incremental financing to cdfis to support com munities that lack access to traditional financing • access to banking we helped more than  customers open lowcost checking accounts with no overdraft fees opened  community center branches the sidebar that follows includes more details about this initia tive often in areas with larger black hispanic and latino populations and hired over  community managers in underserved commu nities to build relationships with community leaders nonprofits and small businessesour dedication to racial equity is not simply a fiveyear effortwe might not always get it right but we are committed to advancing racial equity and sharing our progress on the journey  updates on specific issues facing our company community building through community banking americans have lost trust in the ability of large institutions like the federal gov ernment national media and big compa nies — even big banks — to understand or care about their needsthis view is well earned particularly among communities of color and lowincome householdssimply put our country has done a bad job of looking out for and creating oppor tunity for everyonewe need to consider more thoughtfully the unique needs of communities across the united statescompanies of all sizes need to show up listen and make the right investments and decisions to earn a neighborhood’s trustand it needs to be done on the ground and in the community itself to be authentic and sustainableimpact is most effective when it is locala local bank branch especially in a low income neighborhood can be successful only when it fits the community’s needsthat is why over the last several years we have shifted our approach to how we offer access to financial health educa tion as well as lowcost products and services to help build wealth especially in black hispanic and latino communi tieswe are delivering this approach through our community center branches unique spaces in the heart of urban communitiesbeginning with har lem in new york city and ventura village in minneapolis we have opened  more community center branches in neighbor hoods like stony island in the south shore of chicago crenshaw in los ange les and wards  and  in washington dcten of these branches were opened since we announced our  billion com mitment to racial equity in octoberthese branches have more space to host grassroots community events small business mentoring sessions and financial health seminarsthe majority were built with minority contractors and we hire local artists to make these locations complement their neighbor hoodswith branches expanding to atlanta baltimore miami philadelphia and tulsa we expect to have  commu nity center branches serving customers in underserved communities by the end ofthe community manager a new role within the bank primarily functions as a local ambassador to build and nurture relationships with community leaders nonprofit partners and small businesseswe have now hired over  community managers in underserved communities and intend to keep growing that numberour community managers have hosted more than  financial health events with over  people in attendance and have participated in  community service eventswe want people who live and work in these communities to feel welcome and included when they visit our brancheswe ask them to come as they are and bring the family or their dogthey are also likely to know the employ ees in the branch as we hire locally — people who live in the community and care about serving their neighborsi’ve attended many grand openings of our community center branches in personthe energy is contagiouswe’ve hosted mayors community partners students and small business customers who have shared their sense of pride and optimism about what these branches mean for their communityour community managers are always front and center at these events connecting people to one another and forging new relationshipswe know that to be sustainable this effort must be measured by resultsour company is closely tracking the number of accounts opened the number of mortgages funded the pace and scale of new small business loans extended and a host of other metrics to ensure that we are achieving results and listening to feedback so we can have even greater impactin october  we published a detailed report on our racial equity ini tiatives including our community center branches and community managers which we intend to continue to provide letting others learn from our experiencewe’re also taking a local approach to our community investments and advocating for local policy solutionsour business is only as strong as our communities so we increased our investments in places like mattapan in boston and oak cliff in dallas to help local minority small busi nesses access the capital and support they need to growwe’ve expanded our homebuyer grant program which pro vides  to cover closing costs and down payments when customers buy homes in  minority neighborhoods nationwidewe are also looking at alter native credit scores and other ways to increase homeownership in underserved communities and build generational wealth and stabilitywe call this going from “community banking” to “community building” and it is an important evolution in serving com munities where it is long overduewhile it is early our approach has the promise to create real local impact  updates on specific issues facing our company morgan health is helping us lead in healthcare transformationjpmorganchase spends  billion on compensa tion and benefits for our  employeesof that amount about  billion is directed to medical costs for our employees and their fami lies — approximately  peopleour employees also spend approximately  million on their own medical caremedical care costs may be our most important benefit costs because they have a critical impact on the health and well being of our employees and their familiesas our employees remain our most valuable asset improving the quality and delivery of healthcare services is a high prioritymanaging the complexities of healthcare is stag gering whether you are an individual or a corpo ration — from coping with actual health issues covering the spectrum of a bad back to diabetes to cancer and locating suitable primary or spe cialist care to deciphering incomprehensible insurance plans and pricing resolving excessive surprise bills and other issueswhile the us healthcare system is exceptional in many ways it also has many flaws that must be addressedhealthcare costs which are already the highest in the world continue to rise average premiums for family coverage have increased  since  for both employers and employees — with no evi dence that outcomes are improving eg only  of adults with private insurance have their blood pressure controlled and that number has declined in the last  yearsthis is why in  we launched morgan health a new business unitwith morgan health we have an opportunity to deliver and scale new health care models that improve the quality equity and affordability of employersponsored healthcarewe’re focused on connecting healthcare to improved health outcomes for our employeesjpmorganchase has approximately  talented people on our human resources benefits team helping employees and their families access the best possible medical carein hindsight it is shocking how few people we had dedicated to this vitally important issuewith morgan health we are adding approximately  more individuals who will help our benefits team attack this prob lem from many different angleslooking forward morgan health is investing  million to accelerate the development and delivery of accountable care managing a patient’s total care from prevention to outcomes complet ing its first  million investment in vera whole health — and its subsequent investment in cast light — with plans to deploy these services to our employees in columbus ohio this yearmorgan health just completed another investment in healthcare analytics company embold health which will help facilitate how consumers access the highestquality care availablewe are also working toward providing equal access to equal healthcare regardless of race income or other personal characteristics for our employees and in the communities we serveaddressing inequities in healthcare is fundamental to morgan health’s strategy and our partnership with kaiser perman ente in california is moving forward quickly on its collaborative effort focused on the collection and reporting of health equity performance metricswe continue to support datadriven policymaking through the jpmorganchase policycenter and institutelast year i wrote that one lesson of leadership is putting in place good decisionmaking processesan essential part of that is good data because the challenges we face are complex and intercon nectedtoo often decision makers use “facts” to justify a preexisting point of view or do not accurately represent realitygood data that is granular and timely and when possible lever ages big data sources must be at the heart of all policy processes to ensure measurable and equi table outcomessix years ago we created the jpmorganchase institute to deliver unique data and insights to help solve some of our most pressing economic challengesthis information offers a unique lens into the financial habits of millions of small busi nesses and households leveraging anonymized and aggregated customer data that represents  updates on specific issues facing our company half of us householdsthe institute’s data and analyses have helped policymakers better under stand the impact of decisions — ranging from student loan relief and targeted investments in underserved chicago and detroit neighborhoods to small business support and insights about how families manage income volatility and use their tax refundsimportantly the institute has also helped shape some of our own products and employee benefits including how we incentivize customers to save more money and reduce health insurance deductibles for our lowerpaid employeesthe institute’s work has also helped inform our policy advocacy efforts that support inclusive growthtwo years ago we launched the jpmorganchase policycenter to drive this workgrounded in data we are developing and advocating for policy aimed at reducing structural barriers to economic mobility and broadening opportunity for millions of families who live on the financial margins and have been most impacted by covidfor example as congress was debating expanded unemployment benefits our research showed how these benefits had boosted spending and stimulated economic activity during covidadditional research has provided insight into household balances cutting across income levels and providing an important barometer on how households are faring as government support expiresthis work is not easy but we believe it’s impera tive that policymaking include private and public sector partnershipwe continue to need better data to understand what is happening in the real economy so we can help shape policies that make a significant and positive impact on those who need help the mostwe join other companies in evolving our vision of the workplacetoday in many places covid has moved from pandemic to endemic status although there is still suffering in some parts of the worldand we are cognizant that the risk of new variants is real and that if they occur we will need to take appro priate actionas a company while we continually prepare for multiple business resiliency scenarios eg data center failures closures of cities major storms even widespread disease we never fully pre pared for a pandemic that entailed a largescale shutdown of the global economyalthough some of our employees particularly in the branches continued to work on our premises every day we quickly set up the technology — ranging from call centers and operations to trading and investment banking — that enabled many of our employees to work from homewe learned that we could func tion virtually with zoom and cisco and maintain productivity at least in the short runalthough the pandemic changed the way we work in many ways for the most part it only acceler ated ongoing trendswhile it’s clear that working from home will become more permanent in american business such arrangements also need to work for both the company and its clientsi believe our firm’s onsite versus remote work will sort out something like this • generally speaking many employees approxi mately  will necessarily work at a location full timethat would include nearly all employ ees in our retail bank branches as well as jobs in check processing vaults sales and trading critical operations functions and facilities amenities security medical and many others • some employees approximately  will work under a hybrid model eg some days on site and other days at homeincreased flexibil ity and hybrid working arrangements will vary by job typewe do hope to provide these types of arrangements where they are appropriate and for those who want them  updates on specific issues facing our company • a small percentage of employees possibly  may work full time from home in very specific rolesin all situations these decisions depend upon what is optimal for our company and our clients and we will extensively monitor and ana lyze outcomes to ensure this is the caseas we reopen and we mostly are we will of course follow government guidelinesremote work will change how we manage our real estatewe will quickly move to a more “open seating” arrangement in which digital tools will help manage seating arrangements people will have regular neighborhoods where they can con gregate as well as needed amenities such as conference room spaceas a result for every  employees we may need seats for approximately  to  on average — with an appropriate increase in conference room private office and amenity space to make it a great work environmentthe virtual world also presents some serious weaknessesfor example • performing jobs remotely is more successful when people know one another and already have a large body of existing work to doit does not work as well when people don’t know each other • most professionals learn their job through an apprenticeship model which is almost impos sible to replicate in the zoom worldsince the onset of covid jpmorganchase has hired over  new people into the company — and we are making sure they are properly trained on all aspects of our business from their special role to the significance of conduct and culturebut this is harder to do over zoomover time this drawback could dramatically undermine the character and culture you want to promote in your company • a heavy reliance on zoom meetings actually slows down decision making because there is less immediate followup • remote work eliminates much spontaneous learning and creativity because you don’t run into people at the coffee machine talk with clients in unplanned scenarios or travel to meet with customers and employees for feedback on your products and services • finally the negative effects of the weaknesses outlined above are cumulative — they weren’t as obvious earlier in the pandemic — and they get worse over timewe are moving full steam ahead with building our new headquarters in new york citywe will of course consolidate even more employees into this building which will house between  and  peoplewe are extremely excited about the building’s public spaces stateofthe art technology and health and wellness ameni ties among

training and getting more income to lower paid workers would hugely benefit the economy the individuals involved and social outcomes — and would help rectify income inequalitywe must do a better job improving the outcomes of an edu cation ie that it leads to wellpaying jobsi also believe that we should immediately increase the minimum wage and the eitc to both entice more people into the workforce and to get more income into the hands of the lower paidnurture the extraordinary value of trusttrust is earned given and receivedto maximize human creativity and freedoms — which are the greatest gifts of capitalism — trust is essentialwe must make it safe to argue disagree and challenge each other while continuing to dig deeper in areas where we’re not doing as well as we’d likeit must be okay to fail or make mis takestrust is the force multiplier that gets the best out of everyoneyou do not earn trust if you fingerpoint don’t admit to your own mistakes or don’t share the creditcombat the enemy withinwhile trust is the force multiplier a workplace cannot devolve into excessive feelgood collabo ration and bureaucracyi have seen work envi ronments in which everyone is so nice to each other and so collaborative that it slowly creates crippling bureaucracy as everyone’s opinion is sought out — and everyone has a vetothe other disease that arises from within is a workplace completely run by corporate head quarters it is very easy to be critical of people in the field for their failures when you don’t walk in the trenches with themvery often the enemy within fights change resists making bold decisions and balks at invest ments that are hard such as growing the sales forcewhen the enemy within takes over energy and creativity wither quickly … although it may take decades for the company to diedrive high performance the right wayso how do you drive high performance while cre ating a safe workplace that values relationships built on trust and respect the best leaders treat all people properly and respectfully from clerks to ceoseveryone needs to help one another at a company because everyone’s collective purpose is to serve clientswhen strong leaders consider promoting people they pick those who are respected by their colleagues and ask them selves “would i want to work for him would i want my kid to report to her” we must strive for continuous improvement set high standards and emphasize the negatives when we observe them but always remember to make life funwhen i travel around the world and see our people and our company in action i love itand you must make it fun — not only because it has a positive effect on retention attitude and the overall culture of the company but also because it leads to sharing and truthtellingi’ve enjoyed the show “ted lasso” he tries to get the best out of everybody and he displays great gratitudewhile i could get a little better at show ing more gratitude on a daytoday basis with my management team i did give them biscuits in lit tle pink boxes this year they do know how much i trust respect appreciate and admire themthree additional things you don’t create a win ning team by pandering to individualsyou must deal with conflict immediately directly and forth rightly — problems do not age wellwhen people cannot do their job they should not have that jobwe should either work with them to find another role where they can thrive or ask them to leavejust do it respectfully to everyone involved — do not embarrass people who have been working for the companybring energy and drive — not just every day — but to every meeting and interactionfinally sharing credit recognizing the contribu tions of others and not casting blame or finger pointing all are critical to earning trust  management lesson the benefit of purpose and the tremendous value of work retaining talent is important and so is life outside of workretaining your best talent is essentialin addition to being treated with enormous respect what people want most is a challenging job with mean ingful workall companies have turnover in staff and all turn over is not necessarily badpeople seek out new challenges may find outside advancement oppor tunities or may just want a change in lifestylesometimes good people leave because they are getting a better opportunity or increased com pensation at another companyyou should not be angry when someone receives a higher compen sation offer from another companyno one likes to feel they are being taken advantage of — everyone wants to go home each day thinking jamie dimon chairman and chief executive officer april   they are treated fairly and equitablyand everyone has their own needs in terms of family income worklife balance and other factorsbut turnover can be bad tooit is bad when inef ficiency or bureaucracy or ineffective managers drive out good talentit is still true that most people leave their job because they don’t like their bosswe also recognize and ask our employees to take care of their mind body spirit soul friends and familywhile we do what we can to help them we recognize that these are the most important

have taken many actions that should give our shareholders clients and regulators comfort and demonstrate that our company is rock solidthe actions we have taken to strengthen our companyin this section we describe the many actions that we have taken to make our company stronger and safer our fortress balance sheet with enhanced capital and liquidity our ability to survive extreme stress of multiple types our extensive derisking and simplification of the busi ness and the building of fortress controls in meeting far more stringent regulatory stan dardstaken together these actions have enabled us to make extraordinary progress toward reducing and ultimately eliminating the risk of jpmorganchase failing and the cost of any failure being borne by the american taxpayer or the us economyiiwe must and will protect our company and those we serve you say you have a “fortress balance sheet” what does that mean can you handle the extreme stress that seems to happen around the world from time to time nearly every year since the great recession we have improved virtually every measure of financial strength including many new onesit’s important to note as a starting point that in the worst years of  and  jpmorganchase did absolutely fine – we never lost money we continued to serve our clients and we had the wherewithal and capability to buy and integrate bear stearns and washington mutualthat said we none theless recognize that many americans did not do fine and the financial crisis exposed weaknesses in the mortgage market and other areaslater in this letter i will also describe what we are doing to strengthen jpmorganchase and to help support the entire economythe chart on page  shows many of the measures of our financial strength – both from the year preceding the crisis and our improvement in the last year alonein addition every year the federal reserve puts all large banks through a very severe and very detailed stress testamong other things last year’s stress test assumed that unemployment would go to  housing prices would fall  equity markets would decline by nearly  real gross domestic product gdp would decline  credit spreads would widen dramati cally and oil prices would rise to  per barrelthe stress test also assumed an instan taneous global market shock effectively far worse than the one that happened in  causing large trading lossesit also assumed the failure of the largest counterparty this is meant to capture the failure of the global bank that you have the most extensive deriva tive relationship with eg a lehmantype event which would cause additional lossesthe stress test assumed that banks would not stop buying back stock – therefore depleting their capital – and would continue to grow dramatically of course growing dramati cally and buying back stock if your bank were under stress would be irresponsible – and is something we would never do under this assumed stress the federal reserve esti mates that jpmorganchase would lose  footnote our chief operating officer matt zames talks in his letter on pages – about many important initiatives to protect our company including our physical security and cybersecurity so i will not duplicate any of that information    billion pretax over a ninequarter period an amount that we would easily manage because of the strength of our capital baseremember the federal reserve stress test is not a forecast – it appropriately assumes multiple levels of conservatism and that very little mitigating action can be takenhowever we believe that if the stress scenario actually happened we would incur minimal losses over a cumulative nine quarter period because of the extensive miti gating actions that we would takeit bears repeating that in the actual great recession which was not unlike last year’s stress test jpmorganchase never lost money in any quarter and was quite profitable over the ninequarter periodthe stress test is extremely severe on creditthe  comprehensive capital

counterparty losses were  billionwe have two compar isons that should give comfort that our losses would never be this largefirst recall what actually happened to us inin the worst quarter of  we lost  billion for the entire year we made  billion in trading revenue in the investment bank which included some modest losses on the lehman default one of our largest counterpartiesthe trading books are much more conservative today than they were in  and at that time we were still paying a considerable cost for assimilating and derisking bear stearnssecond we run hundreds of stress tests of our own each week across our global trading operations to ensure our ability to withstand and survive many bad and extreme scenariosthese scenarios include events such as what happened in  other historically damaging events and also new situations that might occurwe manage our company so that even under the worst market stress test conditions we would almost never bear a loss of more than  billion remember we earn approximately  billion pretax preprovision each quarterwe recognize that on rare occa sions we could experience a negative signifi cant event that could lead to our having a poor quarterbut we will be vigilant and will never take such a high degree of risk that it jeopardizes the health of our company and our ability to continue to serve our clientsthis is a bedrock principlelater in this letter i will also describe how we think about idiosyncratic geopolitical riskand the capital we have to bear losses is enormouswe have an extraordinary amount of capital to sustain us in the event of lossesit is instructive to compare assumed extreme losses against how much capital we have for this purposeyou can see in the table below that jpmorganchase alone has enough loss absorbing resources to bear all the losses assumed by ccar of the  largest banks in the united statesbecause of regulations and higher capital large banks in the united states are far strongerand even if any one bank might fail in my opinion there is virtually no chance of a domino effectour shareholders should understand that while large banks do significant business with each other they do not directly extend much credit to one otherand when they trade derivatives they mark tomarket and post collateral to each other every dayresilience of jpmorganchase through multiple layers of

and are getting betterthe intense efforts over the last few years across our operating businesses – risk finance compliance legal and audit – are now yielding real results that will protect the company in the futurewe have reinforced a culture of accountability for assuming risk and have come a long way in selfidentifying and fixing shortcomingsmany new perma nent organizational structures have been put in place to ensure constant review and continuous improvementfor example we now have a permanent oversight  control groupthe group is charged with enhancing the firm’s control environment by looking within and across the lines of business and corporate functions to identify and remediate control issuesthis func tion enables us to detect control problems more quickly escalate issues promptly and engage other stakeholders to understand however we are going to be extremely vigi lant to do more derisking if we believe that something creates additional legal regulatory or political riskswe regularly review all our business activities and try to exceed – not just meet – regulatory demandswe also now ask our legal department to be on the search for “emerging legal risks” we try to think differently for example we try to look at legal risks not based on how the law is today but based on how the law might be inter preted differently  years from nowit is perfectly reasonable for the legal and regula have you completed your major derisking initiatives yes we have completed our major derisking initiatives and some were pretty draconianin the chart below i show just a few of the actions that we were willing to take to reduce various forms of risk tory agencies to want to improve the quality of the businesses they oversee particularly around important issues such as customer protectionwe also expect this refinement frequently will be achieved through enforce ment actions as opposed to the adoption of new rules that raise standardsfor many years regulations generally were viewed as being staticas we do everywhere else we should be striving for constant improvement to stay ahead of the curveexecuted significant business

foundation is in placefar more is spent on controls if you include the time and effort expended by frontoffice personnel committees and reviews as well as certain technology and operations functionswe have also made a very substantial amount of progress in antimoney launderingbank secrecy actwe deployed a new antimoney laundering aml system mantas which is a moni toring platform for all global payment transactionsit now is functioning across our company and utilizes sophisticated algo rithms that are regularly enhanced based on transactional experiencewe review elec tronically  trillion of gross payments each month and then on average  transactions are reviewed by humans after algorithms identify any single transaction as a potential issuefollowing this effort we stopped doing business with  customers inwe also are required to file suspicious activity reports sar with the government on any suspicious activitylast year we filed  sars and we estimate that the industry as a whole files millions each yearwe understand how important this activity is not just to protect our company but to help protect our country from criminals and terroristswe exited or restricted approximately  foreign correspondent banking relationships and tens of thousands of client relationships to simplify our business and to reduce our aml riskthe cost of doing proper aml kyc know your customer diligence on a client increased dramatically making many of these relationships immediately unprofit ablebut we did not exit simply due to profit ability – we could have maintained unprofit able client relationships to be supportive of countries around the world that are allies to the united statesthe real reason we exited was often because of the extraordinary legal risk if we were to make a mistakein many of these places it simply is impossible to meet the new requirements and if you make just one mistake the regulatory and legal conse quences can be severe and disproportionatewe also remediated  accounts for kyc – across the private bank commercial bank and the corporate  investment bankthis exercise vastly improved our data gave us far more information on our clients and also led to our exiting a small number of client relationshipswe will be vigilant on onboarding and maintaining files on all new clients in order to stay as far away as we can from any client with unreasonable riskin all cases we carefully tried to get the balance right while treating customers fairlyyou can see that we are doing everything in our power to meet and even exceed the spirit and the letter of the law to avoid making mistakes and the high cost – both monetarily and to our reputation – that comes with thatbut we also tried to make sure that in our quest to eliminate risk we did not ask a lot of good clients to exitwe hope that in the future the regulatory response to any mistakes – if and when they happen and they will happen – will take into account the extraordinary effort to get it right   many of the processes we implemented for ccar and amlkyc had to be done quickly and many were effectively handled outside our normal processeseventually ccar will be embedded into our normal forecasting and budgeting systemsand we are trying to build the data collection part of kyc into a utility that the entire industry can use – not just for us and our peer group but equally important for the client’s benefit the client would essentially only have to fill out one form which then could be used by all banksin addition throughout the company contin ually creating straightthrough processing online client service and other initiatives will both improve the client experience and decrease our costswhat is all this talk of regulatory optimization and don’t some of these things hurt clients when will you know the final rules in the last year we took some dramatic actions to reduce our gsib capital surcharge which we now have successfully reduced from  to an estimate ofthese steps included reducing nonoperating deposits by approximately  billion level  assets by  billion and notional deriva tives amounts by  trillionwe did this faster than we or anyone thought we couldwe still will be working to further reduce the gsib surcharge but any reduction from this point will take a few yearslike us most banks are modifying their business models and client relationships to accomplish their regulatory objectiveswe are doing this by managing our constraints at the most granular level possible – by product client or businessclearly some of these constraints including gsib and ccar cannot be fully pushed down to the clientimportantly we are focused on clientfriendly execution – and we recog nize that these constraints are of no direct concern to clientsto protect the company and to meet standards of safety and soundness don’t you have to earn a fair profit many banks say that the cost of all the new rules makes this hard to dohaving enough capital and liquidity and even the most solid fortress controls doesn’t make you completely safe and sounddeliv ering proper profit margins and maintaining profitability through a normal credit cycle also are importanta business does this by having the appropriate business mix making good loans and managing expenses over timeclearly some of the new rules create expenses and burdens on our companysome of these expenses will eventually be passed on to clients but we have many ways to manage our expensessimplifying our business streamlining our procedures and automating and digitizing processes some of which previously were being done effectively by hand all will bring relieffor example in the new world our company has approxi mately  new or significantly enhanced balance sheet and liquidityrelated regulatory requirements – the most critical ones are the gsib capital surcharge ccar the liquidity coverage ratio the supplementary leverage ratio and basel iii capitalbanks must neces sarily optimize across these constraints to be able to meet all their regulatory requirements and importantly earn a profitevery bank has a different binding constraint and over time that constraint may changecurrently our overriding constraint is the gsib capital surchargeour shareholders should bear in mind that the us government requires a gsib capital surcharge that is double that of our international competitorsand this additional charge may ultimately put some us banks at a disadvantage vs international competitorsthis is one reason why we worked so hard to reduce the gsib capital surcharge – we do not want to be an outlier in the long run because of it   unfortunately some of the final rules around capital are still not fully known at this timethere are still several new rules coming that also could impact our company – probably the most important to us is how the gsib capital surcharge is incorporated into the ccar stress testto date we have managed to what we do knowwe believe that when the final rules are made and known we can adjust to them in an appropriate wayas banks change their business models to adapt to the new world some are exiting certain products or regionsmarket shares will change and both products and product pricing will change over timetherefore we think there will be a lot of adjustments to make and tools to deploy so that we can still serve our clients and earn a fair profitwe operate in more than  countries across the globe – and we are constantly analyzing the geopolitical and country risks that we facethe reason we operate in all these countries is not simply because they represent new markets where we can sell our productswhen we operate in a country we serve not only local institutions govern ments and sovereign institutions banks and corporations in that country but also some of those institutions and corporations outside their country along with multinationals when they enter that countrythis creates a huge network effectin all the countries where we operate approximately  of the business is indigenous  is outbound and  is inboundall these institutions need financing and advice ma equity debt and loans risk management foreign exchange and interest rates and asset management services financial planning and investment management as well as operating services custody and cash management in their own countries and globallyit takes decades to build these capabilities and relationships – we cannot go in and out of a country on a whim based on a shortterm feeling about risk in that countrytherefore we need plans for the long term while carefully managing current riskwe carefully monitor risks — country by countryfor each country we take a longterm view of its growth potential across all our lines of businesseach country is different but for the most part emerging and developing markets will grow faster than developed countriesand as they grow the need for our services grows dramaticallywhile we have a future growth plan for each country we obviously can’t know with any certainty everything that will happen or the timing of recessionsno matter what the future brings we make sure that we can easily bear the losses if we are wrong in our assessmentsfor each material country we look at what our losses would be under severe stress not that different from the fed’s ccar stress testwe manage so that should the extreme situation occur we might lose money but we could easily handle the resultbelow are a few examples of how we manage risk while continuing to serve clients in specific countrieschinawe believe it likely that in – years china will be a developed nation probably housing  or more of the top  compa nies globallygoing forward we do not expect china to enjoy the smooth steady growth it has had over the past  yearsreforming inefficient stateowned enterprises developing healthy markets like we have in the united states with full transparency and creating a convertible currency where capital can move freely will not be easythere will be many bumps in the roadwe publicly disclose in our form k that we have approximately  billion of country exposure to chinawe run china through a severe stress test essen tially a major recession with massive defaults and trading losses and we estimate that our losses in this scenario could be approximately  billionwe do not expect this situation to how do you manage geopolitical and country risks   happen but if it did we could easily handle itwe manage our growth in china to try to capture the longterm value and remember this will help a lot of our businesses outside of china too and in a way that would enable us to handle bad unexpected outcomeswe don’t mind having a bad quarter or two but we will not risk our company on any countrythis is how we manage in all countries in which we have material activitybrazilbrazil has had a deteriorating economy shrinking by – over the last yearin addition as i write this letter brazil faces political upheaval as its president is being threatened with impeachment and its former president is being indictedyet the country has a strong judicial system many wellrun companies impressive universities peaceful neighbors and an enormous quan tity of natural resourcesin brazil we have banking relationships with more than  clients approximately  multinational corporations going into brazil to do business and approximately  brazilian companies going outboundour publicly disclosed expo sure to brazil is approximately  billion but we think that in extreme stress we might lose  billionin each of the last three years we actually have made money in brazilwe are not retreating – because the longterm prospects are probably fine – and for decades to come brazilians will appreciate our stead fastness when they most needed itargentinaargentina is now a country with incredible opportunityin the s its gdp per person was larger than that of france whereas today it is barely one third compared with franceargentina is an example of terrible public policy often adopted under the auspices of being good for the people that has resulted in extraordi nary damage to the economyhowever the country has a highly educated population a new president who is making bold and intel ligent moves peaceful neighbors and like brazil an abundance of natural resourcesyou might be surprised to know that for the past  years in spite of the country’s difficulties jpmorganchase has made a modest profit there by consistently serving our clients and the countrythis year we took a little additional risk in argentina with a special financing to help bring the country some stability and help get it back into the global marketswe are hoping that argentina can be an example to the world of what can happen when a country has a good leader who adopts good policyto give you more comfort i want to remind you that throughout all the international crises over the last decade we maintained our businesses in many places that were under stress – such as spain italy greece egypt portugal and irelandin almost every case we did not have any material prob lems and we are able to navigate every issue and continue to serve all our clientsagain we hope this will put us in good stead in these countries for decadeslater in this letter i will talk about another poten tially serious issue – britain possibly leaving the european unionhow do you manage your interest rate exposure are you worried about negative interest rates and the growing differences across countries no we are not worried about negative interest rates in the united statesfor years this country has had fairly consistent job growth and increasingly strong consumers home prices are up and the consumer balance sheet is in the best shape it’s ever been inhousing is in short supply and household formation is going up car sales are at record levels and we see that consumers are spending the gas dividendcompanies are financially sound – while some segments’ profits are down companies have plenty of cashnor are we worried about the diverging interest rate policies around the worldwhile they are a reasonable cause for concern it   is also natural that countries with different growth rates and varying monetary and fiscal policies will have different interest rates and currency movementsi am a little more concerned about the oppo site seeing interest rates rise faster than people expectwe hope rates will rise for a good reason ie strong growth in the united statesdeflationary forces are receding – the deflationary effects of a stronger us dollar plus low commodity and oil prices will disappearwages appear to be going up and china seems to be stabilizingfinally on a technical basis the largest buyers of ustreasuries since the great recession have been the usfederal reserve countries adding to their foreign exchange reserve such as china and us commercial banks in order to meet liquidity requirementsthese three buyers of ustreasuries will not be there in the futureif we ever get a little more consumer and business confidence that would increase the demand for credit as well as reduce the incentive and desire of certain investors to buy ustreasuries because treasuries are the “safe haven” if this scenario were to happen with interest rates on year treasuries on the rise the result is unlikely to be as smooth as we all might hope forare you worried about liquidity in the marketplace what does it mean for jpmorganchase its clients and the broader economy it is good to have healthy markets – it sounds obvious but it’s worth repeatingthere are markets in virtually everything – from corn soybeans and wheat to eggs chicken and pork to cotton commodities and even the weatherfor some reason the debate about having healthy financial markets has become less civil and rationalhealthy financial markets allow investors to buy cheaper and issuers to issue cheaperit is important to have liquidity in difficult times in the financial markets because investors and corporations often have a greater and unexpected need for cashliquidity has gotten worse and we have seen extreme volatility and distortions in several marketsin the last year or two we have seen extreme volatility in the ustreasury market the g foreign exchange markets and the us equity marketswe have also seen more than normal volatility in global credit marketsthese violent market swings are usually an indication of poor liquidityanother peculiar event in the market is tech nical but important ustreasuries have been selling at a discount to their maturity related interest rate swapsone of the surprises is that these markets are some of the most actively traded liquid and standardized in the worldthe good news is that the system is resilient enough to handle the volatilitythe bad news is that we don’t completely understand why this is happeningthere are multiple reasons why this volatility may be happening • there are fewer marketmakers in many markets • marketmakers hold less inventory – prob ably due to the higher capital and liquidity required to be held against trading assets • smaller sizes of trades being offeredit is true that the bidask spreads are still narrow but only if you are buying or selling a small amount of securities • lower availability and higher cost of securi ties financing securities financing is very shortterm borrowing fully and safely collat eralized by treasuries and agency securi ties which often is used for normal money market operations – movement of collat eral shortterm money market investing and legitimate hedging activitiesthis is clearly due to the higher cost of capital and liquidity under the new capital rules   we really need to be prepared for the effects of illiquidity when we have bad marketsin bad markets liquidity normally dries up a bit – the risk is that it will disappear more quicklymany of the new rules are even more procyclical than they were in the  financial crisisin addition psychologically the great recession is still front and center in people’s minds and the instinct to run for the exit may continue to be strongthe real risk is that high volatility rapidly dropping prices and the inability of certain investors and issuers to raise money may not be isolated to the financial marketsthese may feed back into the real economy as they did inthe trading markets are adjusting to the new worldthere are many nonbank participants that are starting to fill in some of the gapseven corporations are holding more cash and liquidity to be more prepared for tough timesso this is something to keep an eye on – but not something to panic aboutin a capitalistic and competitive system we are completely supportive of competi tors trying to fill marketplace needsone warning however nonbank lenders that borrow from individuals and hedge funds or that rely on assetbacked securities will be unable to get all the funding they need in a crisisthis is not a systemic issue because they are still small in size but it will affect funding to individuals small businesses and some middle market companiesjpmorganchase is wellpositioned regardlessit is important for you to know that we are not overly worried about these issues for jpmorganchasewe always try to be prepared to handle violent marketsour actual trading businesses are very strong and it should give you some comfort to know that in all the trading days over the last three years we only had losses on fewer than  days which is extraordinarysometimes wider spreads actually help marketmakers and some repricing of balance sheet posi tions like repo already have helped the consistency of our resultsas usual we try to be there for our clients – in good times and more important in tough times • incomplete and sometimes confusing rules around securitizations and mort gageswe still have not finished all the rules around securitizations and in conjunction with far higher capital costs against certain types of securitizationswe have not had a healthy return to the securitization market • the requirement to report all tradesthis makes it much more difficult to buy securities in quantity particularly illiquid securities because the whole world knows your positionsthis has led to a greater discount for almost all offtherun securi ties these are the securities of an issuer that are less regularly traded • possible structural issues eg high frequency tradinghighfrequency trading usually takes place in small incre ments with most highfrequency traders beginning and ending the day with very little inventoryit appears that traders add liquidity during the day in liquid markets but they mostly disappear in illiquid markets i should point out that many dealers also disappear in illiquid markets all trading positions have capital liquidity disclosure and volcker rule requirements – and they cause high gsib capital surcharges and ccar lossesit is virtually impossible to figure out the cumulative effect of all the requirements or what contributes to whatin our opinion lower liquidity and higher volatility are here to stayone could reasonably argue that lower liquidity and higher volatility are not neces sarily a bad thingwe may have had artifi cially higher liquidity in the past and we are experiencing a return closer to normalyou certainly could argue that if this is a cost of a stronger financial system it is a reason able tradeoffremember the real cost is that purchasers and issuers of securities will over time simply pay more to buy or sellin any event lower liquidity and higher volatility are probably here to stay and everyone will just have to learn to live with them   we need to protect our customers their data and our companywe necessarily have a huge amount of data about our customers because of under writing credit card transactions and other activities and we use some of this data to help serve our customers better i’ll speak more about big data later in this letterand we do extensive work to protect our customers and their data – think cyber security fraud protection etcwe always start from the position that we want to be customer friendlyone item that i think warrants special attention is when our customers want to allow outside parties to have access to their bank accounts and their bank account informationour customers have done this with payment companies aggregators financial planners and otherswe want to be helpful but we have a respon sibility to each of our customers and we are extremely concernedlet me explain why • when we all readily click “i agree” online or on our mobile devices allowing third party access to our bank accounts and financial information it is fairly clear that most of us have no idea what we are agreeing to or how that informa tion might be used by a third partywe have analyzed many of the contracts of these third parties and have come to the following conclusions – far more information is taken than the third party needs in order to do its job – many third parties sell or trade infor mation in a way customers may not understand and the third parties quite often are doing it for their own economic benefit – not for the custom er’s benefit – often this is being done on a daily basis for years after the customer signed up for the services which they may no longer be usingwe simply are asking third parties to limit themselves to what they need in order to serve the customer and to let the customer know exactly what information is being used and why and howin the future instead of giving a third party unlimited access to information in any bank account we hope to build systems that allow us to “push” infor mation – and only that information agreed to by the customer – to that third party • pushing specific information has another benefit customers do not need to provide their bank passcodewhen customers give out their bank passcode they may not realize that if a rogue employee at an aggregator uses this passcode to steal money from the customer’s account the customer not the bank is responsible for any lossyou can rest assured that when the bank is responsible for the loss the customer will be fully reimbursedthat is not quite clear with many third partiesthis lack of clarity and transparency isn’t fair or rightprivacy is of the utmost importancewe need to protect our customers and their datawe are now actively working with all third parties who are willing to work with us to set up data sharing the right waywhy are you making such a big deal about protecting customers’ data in your bank   iiiwe actively develop and support our employees if you were able to travel the world with me to virtually all major cities and coun tries you would see firsthand your company in action and the high quality and character of our peoplejpmorganchase and all its predecessor companies have prided them selves on doing “only firstclass business and in a firstclass way” much of the capability of this company resides in the knowledge expertise and relationships of our peopleand while we always try to bring in fresh talent and new perspectives we are proud that our senior bankers have an average tenure of  yearsthis is testament to their experience and it means they know who to call anywhere around the world to bring the full resources of jpmorganchase to bear for our clientstraveling with me you would see our senior leadership team’s exceptional character culture and capabilityyou also would probably notice that  of this leadership group over  teammates who manage our businesses worldwide is ethnically diverse and more than  are womeneven though we believe that we have excel lent people and a strong positive corporate culture we are always examining new ways to improvehow are you ensuring you have the right conduct and culture we reinforce our culture every chance we getour business principles are at the forefront of everything we do and we need to make these principles part of every major conver sation at the company – from the hiring onboarding and training of new recruits to town halls and management meetings to how we reward and incentivize our peopleto get better at this last year we met with more than  employees in  focus groups around the world to get their feedback on some of our challenges and what we can do to strengthen and improve our culturethat said we acknowledge that we at times have fallen short of the standards we have set for ourselvesthis year the company pleaded guilty to a single antitrust viola tion as part of a settlement with the usdepartment of justice related to foreign exchange activitiesthe conduct underlying the antitrust charge is principally attribut able to a single trader who has since been dismissed and his coordination with traders at other firmsas we said at the time one lesson is that the conduct of a small group of employees or of even a single employee can reflect badly on all of us and can have signifi cant ramifications for the entire firmthat’s why we must be ever vigilant in our commit ment to fortify our controls and enhance our historically strong culture continuing to underscore that doing the right thing is the responsibility of every employee at the companywe all have an obligation to treat our customers and clients fairly to raise our hand when we see something wrong or to speak up about something that we should improve – rather than just complain about it or ignore itwe have intensified training and developmentwe are committed to properly training and developing our people to enable them to grow and succeed throughout their careersour intent is to create effective leaders who embody our business principles   we are helping our employees stay healthy for us having healthy employees is about more than improving the firm’s bottom line it’s about improving our employees’ lives — and sometimes even saving livesin  we estimate that our health  wellness centers intervened in more than  poten tially lifethreatening situations eg urgent cardiac or respiratory issues and many more lives have been positively impacted by our numerous wellness initiativeswe believe that healthy employees are happy employees and that happy employees have more rewarding lives both inside and outside the officeour commitment starts with offering comprehensive benefits programs and policies that support our employees and their familiesto do this jpmorganchase spent  billion in  on medical benefits for employees based in the united states where our medical plan covers more than  employees spouses and partnerswe tier our insurance subsidies so our higher earners pay more and our lower earners pay less — making coverage appropriately affordable for allwe also contributed nearly  million in  for employees’ medical reimbursement accountsand we have structured the plan in a way that preventa tive care and screenings are paid for by the companyour benefits offering is supported by an extensive wellness program which is designed to empower employees to take charge of their healththis includes health and wellness centers health assessments and screenings health advocates employee assis tance and emotional wellbeing programs and physical activity eventsin the first year only  of employees participated in health assessments and wellness screenings but in   of our employees enrolled in the medical plan completed an assess ment and screeninglast year our onsite wellness screenings helped almost  employees detect a health risk or poten tially serious condition and directed them to see a physician for followupon another subject we all know the value of eating lots of vegetables so we’ve made it a priority to offer an abundance of healthy meal and snack options in our onsite cafeterias and vending machinesone of the flagships of our wellness program is our health  wellness center networktwentyseven of our  centers in the united states are staffed with at least one doctornearly half of our employees have access to a local center and  of those with access walked in for a visit last yearthese facilities are vitally important to our peoplein  these centers handled nearly  emergencies — including the  potentially lifesaving interventions which i mentioned abovemaintaining a healthy lifestyle shouldn’t be a chore — it should be funlast year we held our second stepup challenge a global competition that not only kept our employees active it supported five charities that feed the hungrymore than  teams — a total of over  employees — added up their daily steps to take a virtual walk around the worldthey began their journey in new york city and made virtual stops at seven of our office locations before finishing in sydneytogether they logged a total of  billion steps which resulted in the firm donating more than  million to the five designated charities — enough to fund millions of meals around the world   about business issues we have confronted and mistakes we have madein its inaugural year more than  managers attended programs with  sessions held at  global locationsduring  over  managers are expected to attendi person ally take part in many of these sessions which are now being held next to our new york city headquarters at the pierpont leadership center a stateoftheart flagship training center that opened in januaryjpmorganchase has  training programs but we realized that we lacked a very important one new manager develop mentprior to  when our employees became managers at the firm for the first time we basically left them on their own to figure out their new responsibilitiesin  we launched jpmorganchase’s leadership edge a firmwide program to train leaders and develop management skillsthese training programs inculcate our leadership with our values teaching from case studies how are you doing in your diversity efforts we are proud of our diversity … but we have more to doour women leaders represent more than  of our company’s senior leadership and they run major businesses – several units on their own would be among fortune  companiesin addition to having three women on our operating committee – who run asset management finance and legal – some of our other businesses and functions headed by women include auto finance business banking usprivate bank usmergers  acquisitions global equity capital markets global research regulatory affairs global philanthropy our us branch network and firmwide marketingi believe that we have some of the best women leaders in the corporate world globallyto encourage diversity and inclusion in the workplace we have a number of business resource groups brg across the company to bring together members around common interests as well as foster networking and camaraderiegroups are defined by shared affinities including race and cultural heritage generation gender sexual orientation mili tary status and professional rolefor example some of our largest brgs are adelante for hispanic and latino employees access ability for employees affected by a disability aspire for asian and pacific islander employees nextgen for early career professionals and win which focuses on women and their career developmentwin has more than  members globally and we have seen a direct correlation between brg membership and increased promotion mobility and reten tion for those participantson the facing page you can read more about some of the inter esting new programs we have rolled out for employees in specific situationsbut there is one area where we simply have not met the standards that jpmorganchase sets for itself – and that is in increasing africanamerican talent at the firmwhile we think our effort to attract and retain africanamerican talent is as good as at most other companies it simply is not good enoughtherefore we set up a devoted effort – as we did for hiring veterans we’ve hired  veterans – to dramatically step up our effortwe have launched advancing black leaders – a separately staffed and managed initiative to better attract and hire more africanamerican talent while retaining developing and advancing the africanamerican talent we already havewe are taking definitive steps to ensure a successful outcome including an incre mental  million investment identifying a fulltime senior executive to drive the initia tive tripling the number of scholarships we offer to students in this community and launching biasawareness training for all executive directors and managing directorswe hope that over the years this concerted action will make a huge difference   we have implemented a number of policies and programs to make jpmorganchase an even better place to work we want jpmorganchase to be considered the best place to work — periodbelow are some meaningful new programs that will help us both attract talent and keep our best peopleour reentry programour reentry program now in its third year has been incredibly successful in helping individuals who have taken a five to year or longer voluntary break get back into the workforcethese are highly accomplished professionals who have prior financial services experience at or above the vice president level but who may need help reentering the corporate work environmentwe offer participants an week fellowship to refresh their skills and rebuild their networkit is a great way to bring outstanding experienced workers — who often are women — to jpmorganchase to begin the second phase of their careerin three years  fellows have been brought into the program and  of those fellows have been placed in fulltime rolesmaternity mentorsa common reason for taking a prolonged break from work is the birth of a childbecoming a parent is both joyful and stressful so we want to do everything we can to support our employees through this lifechanging eventlast year we extended primary caregiver parental leave to  weeks up from  and this year we are introducing a firmwide maternity mentorship programthe program will pair senior employees who have gone through the parental leave process with those who are doing so for the first timeit was piloted last year to overwhelmingly positive feedback with participants expressing deep appreciation for having a colleague they could turn to for advice on everything from how to balance work with their new home dynamic to nursing room protocolimportantly these senior mentors also provide peace of mind around job security and how to manage the entire transition from preparing to leave managing mother hood during the leave and returning to workin addition this program not only supports the employee going out on mater nity leave but it also helps educate the employee’s manager — on how to stay connected with the employee and ensure that the leave is being handled with flexibility and sensitivity in order to give the employee comfort that her role will be there upon her returnworklife balancewe speak consistently about the need for our employees to take care of their minds their bodies and their soulsthis is the responsibility of each and every employee but there are also ways the firm can helppeople frequently think worklife balance refers to working parents however having an effective balance is important for everyone’s wellbeing including our junior investment bankersin the investment bank we have reduced weekend work to only essential execution work for all employeesand the protected weekend program for analysts and associates will remain in place and now is mandatory for all at this level globally   with all the new rules committees and centralization how can you fight bureaucracy and complacency and keep morale high in the reality of our new world centraliza tion of many critical functions is an abso lute requirement so that we can maintain common standards across the companyof course extreme centralization can lead to stifling bureaucracy less innovation and counterintuitively sometimes a lack of accountability on the part of those who should have itour preference is to decen tralize when we can but when we have to centralize we need to ensure we set up a process that’s efficient works for the customer and respects the internal colleagues who may have lost some local controlprocesses need to be reengineered to be efficientso far our managers have done a great job adjusting to their new roles and in effect getting the best of centralization without its shortcomingswhen on occa sion new procedures have slowed down our response rate to the client we quickly set about reengineering the process to make it betterwhile we are going to meet and exceed all rules and requirements we need to ensure that the process is not duplicative or that rules are not misappliedfor example adhering to the new kyc rules took us up to  days to onboard a client to our private bankbut today after reengineering the process we are back down to three days incorporating enhanced controlswe all need to recognize that good processes generally are faster cheaper and safer for all involved including the clientpeople should not just accept bureaucracy — they have the right to question processes and the interpretation of ruleswe have given all our people the license to question whether what we are doing is the right thing including the interpretation of rules and regulationsvery often in our desire to exceed regulatory requirements and to avoid making a mistake we have inaccurately interpreted a rule or regulation and created our own excessive bureaucracythis is no one’s fault but our owneveryone should look to simplify and seek out best practices including asking our regulators for guidancecommittees need to be properly run — the chair person needs to take chargewe have asked all our committees to become more efficientfor example we should ensure that prereading materials are accurate and succinctthe right people need to be in the room and very rarely should the group exceed  peoplean issue should not be presented to multiple committees when it could be dealt with in just one committee remember we have new business initiative approval committees credit committees reputational risk commit tees capital governance committees global technology architecture committees and hundreds of otherswe have asked that each chair of every committee take charge – start meetings on time make sure people arrive prepared and actually have read the preread documents eliminate frivolous conversation force the right questions to get to a decision read the riot act to someone behaving badly maintain a detailed followup list specifying who is responsible for what and when and ensure the committee meets its obligations and time commitmentsand last we encourage each chair to ask the internal customers if he or she is doing a good job for themwe have maintained high moraleour people have embraced the new regulations and are working hard to become the gold standard in how we operatewe don’t spend any time fingerpointing or scapegoating our own people looking for someone to blame purely for the sake of doing so when we make a mistakeand importantly we have main tained a culture that allows for mistakesobviously if someone violates our core prin ciples that person should not be herebut as you know there are all types of mistakes   we don’t want to be known as a company that doesn’t give people a second chance regardless of the circumstancesi remind all our managers that some of these mistakes will be made by our children our spouses or our parentshaving a brutal uncompro mising and unforgiving company will create a terrible culture over time – and it will lead to worse conduct not betterquite well thank youthe board of directors and i feel we have one of the best manage ment teams we have ever hadmany of our investors who have spent a considerable amount of time with our leaders – not just with my direct reports but with the layer of management below them – will tell you how impressed they are with the depth and breadth of our management teamof course we have lost some people but we wish them well – we are proud of our alumnione of the negatives of being a good company is that you do become a breeding ground for talent and a recruiting target for competitorsit is the job of our management team to keep our key talent educated engaged motivated and happyour people are so good that we should say thank you every dayhow are you doing retaining key people our company has stood the test of time because we are building a strong culture and are embedding our principles in everything we donothing is more importantthat is the pillar upon which all things rest – and it is the foundation for a successful future  ivwe are here to serve our clients we have to be innovating all the time to succeedinvesting in the future is critical to our business and crucial for our growthevery year we ask “are we doing enough and should we be spending more” we do not cut back on “good spending” to meet budget or earnings targetswe view this type of cost cutting like an airline scaling back on maintenance – it’s a bad ideawe spent more than  billion last year on technologyimportantly  of this total amount was spent on new investments for the futuretoday we have more than  technolo gists from programmers and analysts to systems engineers and application designersin addition our resources include  data centers  physical servers globally  databases and a global network that operates smoothly for all our clientsthere are many new technologies that i will not discuss here think cloud containerization and virtualization but which will make every single part of this ecosystem increas ingly more efficient over timewe need to innovate in both big and small waystechnology often comes in big waves – such as computerization the internet and mobile deviceshowever plenty of important innovation involves lots of little things that are additive over time and make a product or a service better or faster for example simplifying online applications improving atms to do more eg depositing checks and speeding up credit underwritingmany of these improvements were not just the result of technology but the result of teams of people across legal finance technology and client coverage  support working together to understand simplify and auto mate processesone of our growing teams is our digital group including more than  profes sionals focused on product and platform design and innovationin addition the digital technology organization has over  technologists that deliver digital solutions including frameworks development and architecturethis is an exceptional group but you can judge for yourself when you read about some of the great projects being rolled outwe have thousands of such projects but i just want to give you a sample of some of our current initiatives i will talk extensively later about investments in payments in big data and in our investment bank • consumer digitalwe are intently focused on delivering differentiated digital experi ences across our consumer businessesfor example we added new functionality to our mobile app with account preview and check viewing and we redesigned chasecom with simpler navigation and more personalized experiences making it easier for our customers to bank and interact with us when and how they want – via smartphones laptops and other mobile deviceswe now have nearly  million active chase mobile customers a  increase over the prior yearmany of the new and exciting things we are doing center on technology including big data and fintechwe are continually inno vating to serve our clients better faster and cheaper – year after yearhow do you view innovation technology and fintech and have banks been good innovators do you have economies of scale and how are they benefiting your clients   • digital and global wealth managementwe will be investing approximately  million over the next three years in digital initiatives for asset manage mentin global wealth management we have modernized the online experience for clients enabled mobile access and launched a digital portal for access to our research and analysis across all channelsin addition we are rolling out a user friendly and powerful planning tool that our advisors can use with clients in real timewe are also working on some great new initiatives around digital wealth management which we will disclose later this year • digital commercial bankingin commercial banking jpmorgan access delivers a platform for clients to manage and pull together all their treasury activities in a single secure portal which was ranked as the  cash management portal in north america by greenwich associates inwe continue to invest in digital enhance ments releasing in  our proprietary and integrated mobile solution for remote check deposits to help clients further streamline their backoffice reconciliationswe are also investing in improving the overall user experience around key items such as entitlements designating who can make payments and workflow bringing to our commercial digital platforms some of the same enhancements we’ve brought to our consumer banking siteswhile we make a huge effort to protect our own company in terms of cybersecu rity we try to help protect our clients from cyber threats as wellwe have extensive fraud and malware detection capabilities that significantly reduce wire fraud on our customerswe’ve increased our client cybersecurity education and awareness programs having communicated with more than  corporate customers on this topic and hosting nearly  cybersecu rity client events in  • small business digitalsmall businesses are important to chase and to the communi ties we servesmall businesses have a variety of banking needs with approxi mately  of our customers using our checking accounts or business credit cardsand like our consumer client base they depend heavily on the technology that already is offered in our consumer busi nessbut we are very excited about two new initiatives this year – our new brand “chase for business” is not just a brandover time we will simplify forms speed applications and dramatically improve the customer experiencethis year or next we will roll out an online digital applica tion that allows a business banking customer to sign up for the “triple play” with one signature and in one day “triple play” stands for a deposit account a business credit card and chase merchant processing – all at oncenow that’s customer service – chase business quick capitalworking with a fintech company called ondeck we will be piloting a new working capital productthe process will be entirely digital with approval and funding generally received within one day vs the current process that can take up to one month or morethe loans will be chase branded retained on our balance sheet and subject to our pricing and risk parameters • commercial term lendingin our commer cial term lending business our competi tive advantage is our process – we strive to close commercial real estate loans faster and more efficiently than the industry averagethat has allowed us to drive  billion of loan growth since  representing a fiveyear compound average growth rate cagr of  and outpacing the industry cagr of  while maintaining credit disciplinetechnological innovation will continue to improve our process – later in the year we will be rolling out a proprietary loan   origination system that will set a new industry standard for closure speed and customer serviceyes we are always improving our economies of scale to the ultimate benefit of our clientsand yes over time banks have been enormous innovatorswe commonly hear the comment that a bank of our size cannot generate economies of scale that benefit the clientand we often hear people say that banks don’t innovateneither of these comments is accuratebelow i give a few examples of the large and small innovations that we are working on • consumer and small business banking accountsmany decades ago bank accounts meant checks and a monthly statement with few additional benefits provided to customers other than maybe a toastertoday most checking accounts come with many benefits debit cards online bill pay hour access to online account informa tion fraud alerts mobile banking relevant rewards and atm access • atmstoday atms are ubiquitous we have almost  atms and our customers love themthese atms have gone from simple cash dispensers to stateoftheart service centers allowing customers to receive different denomina tions of bills accept deposited checks pay certain bills and access all their accounts • the cost and ability to raise capital and buy and sell securitiesthirty years ago it cost on average  cents to trade a share of stock  basis points to buy or sell a corporate singlea bond and  to do a  million interest rate swaptoday it costs on average  cents to trade a share of stock  basis points to buy a corporate singlea bond and  to do a  million interest rate swapand much can be done electronically increasingly on a mobile device and with mostly straightthrough processing which reduces error rates and operational costs – for both us and our clientsthese capa bilities have dramatically reduced costs to investors and issuers for capital raising and securities transactions • cash management capabilities for corpora tionsit is impossible to describe in a few sentences what companies had to do to move money around the world  years agotoday people can move money glob ally on mobile devices and immediately convert it into almost any currency they wantthey have instant access to informa tion and the cost is a fraction of what it used to befintech and innovation have been going on my entire career — it’s just faster todayif you look at the banking business over decades it has always been a huge user of new technologiesthis has been going on my entire career though it does appear to be accelerating and coming at us from many different angleswhile many fintech firms are good at utilizing new technologies we should recognize that they are very good at analyzing and fixing business problems and improving the customer experience ie reducing pain pointssometimes they find a way to provide these services more efficiently and in a less costly manner for example cloud servicesand sometimes these services are not less expensive but provide a faster and simplified experience that customers value and are willing to pay foryou see this in some fintech lending and payment servicesit is unquestionable that fintech will force financial institutions to move more quickly and banks regulators and government policy will need to keep paceservices will be rolled out faster and more of them will be executed on a mobile devicefintech has been great at making it easier and often less expensive for customers and will likely lead to many more people including more lowerincome people joining the banking system in the united states and abroad   you can rest assured that we continually and vigorously analyze the marketplace including fintech companieswe want to stay up to date and be extremely informed and we are always looking for ways to improve what we dowe are perfectly willing to compete by building capabilities we have large capabilities inhouse or to collaborate by partneringwhether we compete or collaborate we try to do what is in the best interest of the customerwe also partner with more than  fintech companies – just as we have partnered over the past decade with hundreds of other technology providerswe need to be very technologically competent because we know that some of our competi tors will be very goodall businesses have clear weak spots and those weaknesses will be – and should be – exploited by competi torsthis is how competitive markets workone of the areas we spend a lot of time thinking and worrying about is paymentspart of the payments system is based on archaic legacy architecture that is often unfriendly to the customerhow do you intend to win in payments particularly with so many strong competitors — many from silicon valley right now we are one of the biggest payments companies in the world across credit and debit cards merchant payments global wire transfers etcbut that has not lulled us into a false sense of security – and we know we need to continue to innovate aggressively to grow and win in this areathe trifecta of chase paymentech chasenet and chase pay supported by significant investment in innovation has us very excited and gives us a great opportunity to continue to be one of the leading companies in the payments businesslet me explain whychase paymentechwe already are one of the largest merchant

improves security increases payment processing speed eases reporting and signifi cantly enhances the customer experiencei hope you can see why we are so excitedyou always seem to be segmenting your businesses — how and why are you doing this we will always be segmenting our busi nesses to become more knowledgeable about and closer to the clientthis segmentation allows us to tailor our products and services to better serve their needsbelow are some examples of how and why we do thisin consumer banking we have the benefit of really knowing our customerswe know about their financial stability interests where they live and their familiesthat data can be a tremendous force in serving themby understanding customers well beyond a demographic profile we can better antici pate what they needhistorically we used demographics and behavior to segment our customers but we increasingly take attitudes values and aspirations into consideration to offer each customer more relevant and personalized products services and rewardsas one important example we hope to roll out an “always on offers” section for our customers on chasecom where they can access all the products they qualify for at any given timein commercial banking we continue to develop and enhance our specialized industries coverage which now serves a total of  distinct industries and approximately  clients across the united states with eight industries launched in the last five yearsbelow are a few service examples taken from these new industries • agricultural industry groupnot only do we have specialized underwriting for clients within this group but we also can help our clients navigate commodity price cycles and seasonality as well as provide industryspecific credit and risk manage ment tools such as interest rate and commodity hedging   • healthcare industry groupin addition to delivering access to capital and other financial services we can help our healthcare clients manage the constantly changing regulatory environment and adjust their businesses to comply with the patient protection and affordable care act and other new regulationsin addi tion our webbased tools are making it easier for healthcare providers to migrate payments from expensive paper checks to efficient electronic transactions • technology industry groupto serve our technology clients we have expanded our coverage to include  bankers in  key markets all highly aligned with our investment banking teamwith this model we can provide investment banking services comprehensive payment capabilities and international products to address the needs of technology clients through every stage of growthin asset management we have dedicated groups that cover highly specialized segmentssome of these segments are defined benefit pension plans defined contribution pension plans endowments  foundations family offices and insurance companieshow and why do you use big data we have enormous quantities of data and we have always been data fanatics using big data responsibly in loan underwriting marketmaking client selection credit under writing and risk management among other areasbut comparing today’s big data with yesterday’s oldstyle data is like the differ ence between a mobile phone and a rotary phonebig data truly is powerful and can be used extensively to improve our companyto best utilize our data assets and spur innovation we have built our own extraor dinary inhouse big data capabilities – we think as good as any in silicon valley – populated with more than  analysts and data scientists which we call intelligent solutionsand we are starting to use these capabilities across all our businessesi want to give you a sample of what we are doing – and it is just the beginning • commercial bankingwe are using big data in many ways in commercial bankingone area is responsible prospectingit always was hard to get a proper list of client prospects ie get the prospect’s working telephone number or email address get an accurate description of the business and maybe get an introduction to the decision maker at the companyusing big data we have uncovered and qualified twice as many highquality pros pects and we are significantly more effec tive in assuring that the best banker is calling on the highestpotential prospectsthis has given us confidence in knowing that if we hire more bankers they can be profitably deployed • consumer bankingwithin the consumer bank we use big data to improve under writing deliver more targeted marketing and analyze the root causes of customer attritionthis will lead to more accounts higher marketing efficiencies reduced costs and happy customers   • operational efficienciesin the corporate  investment bank big data is being used to analyze errors thereby improving operational efficienciesin one example in our custody business big data is helping identify and explain the breaks and vari ances in the calculation of net asset values of funds thereby reducing the operational burden and improving client service • operational intelligenceour technology infrastructure creates an enormous amount of machine data from which we gain valuable operational intelligencethis information helps support the stability and resiliency of our systems – enabling us to identify little problems before they become big problems • fraud security and surveillanceneedless to say these big data capabilities are being used to decrease fraud reduce risk in the cyber world and even monitor internal systems to detect employee fraud and bad behaviorwhy are you investing in sales and trading as well as in your investment bank when others seem to be cutting back trading is an absolutely critical function in modern society – for investors large and small and for corporations and governmentsas the world grows the absolute need for trading will increase globally as assets under management trade corporate clients and economies growwe disclosed on investor day that we continue to make a fair profit in almost all our trading businesses despite the higher costs and what is probably a perma nent reduction in volumeswhile the busi ness will always be cyclical we are convinced that our clients will continue to need broad services in all asset classes and that we have the scale to be profitable through the cyclesales and trading educates the world about companies securities and economiesclients will always need advice and the ability to transactthis education also makes it easier for corporations to sell their securities so they can invest and growmuch of the invest ment we are making in sales and trading is in technology both to adjust to new regula tions and to make access to trading faster cheaper and safer than it has been in the pastacross electronic trading we have seen a doubling of users and significant volume increases of  across products in just the last yearbelow are a few examples foreign exchange fxwe continue to make significant investments in fx etrading and our singledealer platformmore than  of our fx spot transactions are now done electronically as the market has increasingly shifted to electronic execution over the yearswe were also first to deliver fx trading on mobile devices through our awardwinning execute application on the jpmorgan markets platformour continued investment in the fx business in which we process an average of nearly  trades each day has propelled us to be a leader in the marketequitiesin the last five years on the back of our investments in both technology and people our us electronic cash equity market share has nearly quadrupledwe have also witnessed an increased straight through processing rate – going from  two years ago to  todayprime brokerageour prime brokerage plat form which was once a predominantly us operation is now a toptier global business that continues to grow clients and balancesour international and dma direct market access electronic footprint has expanded rapidly sincefinancing balances are at alltime highs with international balances up more than  and synthetic balances up more than  simultane ously reducing balance sheet consumption and enhancing returns   rates tradingwith the adoption of new regulations we anticipate that this market will also continue to see increased volumes of etradingas a result we have developed auto mated pricing systems that can price swaps in a fraction of a second on electronic platformsour sef swap execution facility aggregator allows clients to see the best price available to

base metalswe are also extending the same capabilities to energy products where we have executed our first electronic trade in oilwe plan to further extend our etrading capabilities across the commodities markets including agricultural productsderivatives processingthe implementation of our strategic overthecounter derivatives processing platform has promoted a  increase in portfolio volume and a more than  decrease in cost per trade in four yearsthe platform now settles  trillion of derivative notionals each day and has been instrumental in improving operational why are you still in the mortgage business that is a valid questionthe mortgage busi ness can be volatile and has experienced increasingly lower returns as new regula tions add both sizable costs and higher capital requirementsin addition it is not just the cost of the new rules in origination and servicing it is the enormous complexity of those new requirements that can lead to problems and errorsit is now virtually impossible not to make some mistakes – and as you know the price for making an error is very highso why do we want to stay in this business here’s why delivery control and client service as demon strated by a more than  reduction in cash settlement breaks and a  increase in straightthrough processing of equity deriva tives confirmationsin all these cases greater operational efficien cies and higher straightthrough processing drive lower costs and lead to happy clientswe also continue to make investments in research and the coverage of clientsa couple of examples will suffice research platformwe continue our research investments both in the quality of our people and in the number of companies and sectors we coverin  we expanded our global equity research coverage to more than  companies the broadest equity company coverage platform among our competitorswith material increases in the united states – we expanded sector coverage in energy banks insurance and industrials – and in china we doubled our ashare coverageincreased investment banking coveragewe are actively recruiting and hiring senior bankers in areas where we were either underpen etrated or where there has been incremental secular growth such as energy technology healthcare and greater china • mortgages are important to our customersfor most of our customers their home is the single largest purchase they will make in their lifetimemore than that it is an emotional purchase – it is where they are getting their start raising a family or maybe spending their retirement yearsas a bank that wants to build lifelong relationships with its customers we want to be there for them at life’s most critical juncturesmortgages are important to our customers and we still believe that we have the brand and scale to build a higher quality and less volatile mortgage business   • originationswe reduced our product set from  to  we will complete the rollout of a new originations system and we will continue to leverage digital channels to make the application process easier for our customers and more efficient for usin addition we have dramatically reduced federal housing administration fha originationscurrently it simply is too costly and too risky to originate these kinds of mortgagespart of the risk comes from the penalties that the government charges if you make a mistake – and part of the risk is because these types of mortgages default frequentlyand in the new world the cost of default servicing is extraordinarily high • servicingif we had our druthers we would never service a defaulted mortgage againwe do not want to be in the busi ness of foreclosure because it is exceed ingly painful for our customers and it is difficult costly and painful to us and our reputationin part by making fewer fha loans we have helped reduce our foreclo sure inventory by more than  and we are negotiating arrangements with fannie mae and freddie mac to have any delinquent mortgages insured by them be serviced by them • community reinvestment act and fair lendingfinally while making fewer fha loans can make it more difficult to meet our community reinvestment act and fair lending obligations we believe we have solutions in place to responsibly meet these obligations – both the more subjective requirements and the quantita tive components – without unduly jeopar dizing our company   vwe have always supported our communities most large companies are outstanding corpo rate citizens – and they have been for a long timethey compensate their people fairly they provide critical medical and retirement plans and they’re in the forefront of social policy for example in staffing a diverse you seem to be doing more and more to support your communities — how and why since our founding in new york more than  years ago jpmorganchase and its predecessor banks have been leaders in their communitiesthis is nothing newfor example in april  jpmorgan  co made wall street’s largest contribution –  – to as the new york times described it at the time “extend practical sympathy to the stricken people of san francisco” this was two days after the earthquake that destroyed  of the city and killed  peoplein february  we played much the same role when the firm and our employees contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to pay for medical services for children exposed to lead in the flint michigan water crisisand over the last several years we have given more than  million to help in the aftermath of natural disasters from tsunamis in asia to superstorm sandy in the northeast united states and it was gratifying to see how employees rallied with their time and with the full resources of the firm to help workforce hiring veterans and effectively training people for jobsthey like all institu tions are not perfect but they try their best to obey the spirit and the letter of the laws of the land in which they operatein addition to our annual philanthropic giving – which now totals over  million a year – we are putting our resources the expertise of our business leaders our data relationships and knowledge of global markets into significant efforts aimed at boosting economic growth and expanding opportunity for those being left behind in today’s economywe have made longterm global commitments to workforce readi ness getting small businesses the capital and support they need to grow improving consumer financial health and supporting strong urban economiesyou can read more detail about these programs on pagesand in the sidebars in this section you can hear directly from some of our partners about our effortswe think these initia tives will make a significant contribution to creating more economic opportunity for more people around the worldin particular i want to tell you about an exciting new community service program we have developed that is capitalizing on our most important resource – the talent of our peoplethe service corps program recruits topperforming employees from around the world to put their skills and expertise to work on behalf of nonprofit partners that are helping to build stronger communitiesthis program combining leadership devel opment with philanthropic purpose started small in brazil grew into the detroit service corps as part of our investment there and has now spread across the globe with proj ects in africa asia and north and south   americaservice corps employees work onsite with nonprofits on projects that last three weeksin total  people have been involved in  projectsand this program will continue to grow in the coming years to other domestic and international loca tionswhile supporting our nonprofit partners to deliver on their mission our employees also gain enormous satisfaction and sense of purpose from the opportunity to helpin addition as they travel across the globe and interact with their peers they develop a great permanent camara derie that helps unite our employees from around the world in a commitment to make a difference in our communitiespartnership in detroit by mayor mike duggan detroit is coming backafter years of challenges we are seeing signs of real progress in our neighborhoods and business districtstwo years into our administration we’ve brought back fiscal discipline and have balanced the city’s budget for the first time in more than a decadewe’ve installed  new led street lights in our neighborhoodsbuses are running on schedule for the first time in  years and are serving  more riders each weekwe’ve taken down nearly  blighted homes and as a result are seeing doubledigit property value increases across the majority of the cityperhaps most impor tant  more detroiters are working today than two years ago thanks to efforts to attract new investment and develop our workforcenone of these positive steps would have been possible without the partnerships we’ve established in washington dc in our state capital of lansing with the detroit city council and especially with our residents and partners in the business and philanthropic communitieswhen our friends at jpmorganchase started thinking about making a  million investment in detroit they started off by asking about our priorities for the city’s recovery — not just mine but those of our community and philanthropic leaders as welltoday we can see the impact of jpmorganchase’s commitment to detroit in many places — in the opening of a new grocery store in the westside’s harmony village neigh borhood in the minorityled small businesses that are getting muchneeded capital from the new entrepreneurs of color fund and in the map of detroit’s workforce system that is helping us prepare detroiters for the new jobs coming to the cityjpmorganchase is bringing its data expertise and talent to this town in so many ways — assets that are just as important as money in boosting our recoverythe partnerships jpmorganchase saw at work in detroit helped give the firm confidence to invest so significantly in our cityand because we have this fine company at the table we now have other companies coming to our city looking to contribute and invest in detroit and its residentswe still have a long way to gobut with great partners like jpmorganchase we are creating a turnaround that is bene fiting all detroiters and can be a model for other large cities facing similar challenges    creating careerfocused education by freeman ahrabowski iii president of the university of maryland baltimore county too many people are left out of work or are stuck in lowwage lowskill jobs without a path to meaningful employment and the chance to get aheadamong young people this truly is a national tragedy more than  million young americans including one in five africanamerican and one in six latino youths are neither attending school nor workingjpmorganchase’s new skills for youth initiative is an important example of educators and busi ness leaders partnering to equip young people with the skills and experience to be career readythe social and economic hurdles faced by young people of color and those who come from lowincome families have been exacerbated by the growing crisis of high inner city unemployment and low high school graduation rateswith too many young people marginalized economic growth slows and social challenges increasethe public and private sectors must work together to change thiseducators need to emphasize both college and career readinessthey need to recognize that there is growing demand for technically trained middleskill workers — from robotics technicians to licensed practical nurses — and better align what they teach with the talent needs of employersat the same time business leaders need to support the education system as it strives to teach today’s skills and help students develop into critical thinkersa bachelor’s degree is as important as ever and universities must do more to support students of all backgrounds who arrive on our campuseshowever we need to recognize that not all college and career pathways include pursuing a fouryear degree immediately and we need to eliminate the stigma attached to alternate pathshighquality rigorous career and technical education programs can connect people to highskill wellpaying jobs — and they don’t preclude earning a fouryear degree down the roadclasses dedicated to robotics medical science mechanics and coding build skills that employers desperately needthey also prepare students to land great jobsrecent education reforms are making progress but we still need greater focus on preparing young people from all income levels with the skills and experiences to be college and career readythe public and private sectors need to forge deeper relation ships and make greater investments in developing and expanding effective models of careerfocused education that are aligned with the needs of emerging industriesthis is an investment not only in growing our economy but also in providing more of our young people with a tangible path out of poverty and a real chance at economic successcommitment to our vets by stan mcchrystal retired general usarmy in early  two employees of jpmorganchase came to wintry new haven connecticut to talk about veteransspecifically they told me that jamie dimon felt the bank could and should do more to help the many veterans returning from service — many who were in iraq and afghanistan — take their rightful place in civilian societysince  the military had enjoyed tremendous support from the american people but seemingly intractable problems of reintegration particularly challenges with meaningful employment haunted an embarrassingly large number of former warriors and their familiesi listened with interest and no small amount of cautious skepticismi was aware of countless programs initiated with the best of intentions that soon became more talk than action and was worried this might be the samethe jpmorganchase people asked if i thought the bank should create a program to help veterans find employment and if the bank did start such a program would i join the advisory council for iti thought for a moment and then responded “if jamie is seriously willing to commit the bank to the effort” i replied “it’s the right thing to do and i’m inif not there are other far less ambitious ways to offer the bank’s help for veterans” as we talked further they convinced me that jamie and the full energy that jpmorganchase could bring would be behind the effortthat was almost five years ago and jpmorganchase has surpassed my every hope and expectationby committing fulltime talent and including the personal involvement of senior leadership the firm has been the strongest force in veterans’ employment in americathe veteran jobs mission program has not only implemented truly cutting edge programs inside the bank to recruit train mentor and develop veterans — resulting in an increase of more than  veterans within the bank since  — but the program also has demonstrated the power of commitmentan impressive number of american businesses have set and met employment goals to date over  veterans have been hired collectively with a goal of hiring  million that would have been considered unattainable at the start   via safe strong banking industry is absolutely critical to a country’s success — banks’ roles have changed but they will never be a utility for the people of a country to thrive you need a successful economy and marketsfor an economy to be successful it is an absolute necessity to have a healthy and successful banking systemthe united states has a large vibrant financial system from asset managers and private equity sponsors to hedge funds nonbanks venture capital ists public and private market participants small to large investors and banksbanks are at the core of the systemthey educate the world about companies and markets they syndicate credit and market risk they hold and move money and assets and they neces sarily create discipline among borrowers and transparency in the marketto do this well america needs all different kinds of financial institutions and all different kinds of banks – large and smallthere is a great need for the services of all banks from large global banks to smaller regional and community banksthat said our large global corporate  investment bank does things that regional and commu nity banks simply cannot dowe offer unique capabilities to large corporations large investors and governments including federal institutions states and citiesonly large banks can bank large institutionsof the  million businesses in the united states only  are public companieswhile accounting for less than  of all firms these companies represent onethird of private sector employment and almost half of the total  trillion of business capital expendituresand most are multi nationals doing business in many countries around the worldin addition to corpora tions governments and government insti tutions – such as central banks and sover eign wealth funds – need financial servicesthe financial needs of all these institutions are extraordinarywe provide many of the services they requirefor example we essentially maintain checking accounts for these institutions in many countries and currencieswe provide extensive credit lines or raise capital for these clients often in multiple jurisdictions and in multiple curren cieson an average day jpmorganchase does the united states really need large banks moves approximately  trillion for these types of institutions raises or lends  billion of capital for these institutions and buys or sells approximately  trillion of securities to serve investors and issuerswe do all this efficiently and safely for our clientsin addi tion as a firm we spend approximately  million a year on research so that we can educate investors institutions and govern ments about economies markets and compa niesfor countries we raised  billion of capital inwe help these nations develop their capital markets get ratings from ratings agencies and in general expand their knowledgethe fact is that almost everything we do is because clients want and need our various servicesput “large” in contextwhile we are a large bank it might surprise you to know two facts  the assets of all banks in the united states are a much smaller part of the country’s economy relatively than in most other large developed countries and  america’s top five banks by assets are smaller relatively to total banking assets in america than in most other large developed countriesas shown in the following charts this framework means banks in the united states are less consolidated   our size and our diversification make us strongerour large and diversified earnings streams and good margins create a strong base of earnings that can withstand many different crisesstock analysts have pointed out that jpmorganchase has among the lowest earnings volatility and revenue volatility among all banksthis strength is what allows us to invest in countries to support our clients and to have the staying power to survive tough timeswe are a port of safety in almost any stormfinally our size gives us the ability to make large and innovative investments that are often needed to create new products and services or to improve our efficiencythe ultimate beneficiary of all this is our clientscommunity banks are critical to the country — large banks provide essential services to them i prepared this section initially as an oped article but i’d like you to see it in total not long ago i read some commentary excoriating big banks written by the ceo of a regional bankthe grievances weren’t new or surprising – in the current climate one doesn’t have to look far to find someone attacking large financial institutionsbut i recognized this particular bank as a client of oursso i did some diggingit turns out that our firms have a relationship that goes back many years and spans a broad range of servicesand it struck me how powerful the incentive is in today’s heated public dialogue to frame issues as a winnertakeall fight between opposing interests big vs smallmain street vswall streetit is a simple narrative and while banks of all sizes make mistakes certainly a key lesson of the crisis is that mistakes at the largest institutions can impact the broader financial systembut as is often the case reality tells a deeper story and the us financial services industry does not conform to simple narrativesit is a complex ecosystem that depends on diverse business models coexisting because there is no other way to effectively serve ameri ca’s vast array of customers and clientsa healthy banking system depends on institu tions of all sizes to drive innovation build and support our financial infrastructure and provide the essential services that support the us economy and allow it to thrivein our system smaller regional and commu nity banks play an indispensable rolethese institutions sit close to the communities they servetheir highestranking corporate officers live in the same neighborhoods as their clientsthey are able to forge deep and longstanding relationships and bring a keen knowledge of the local economy and culturethey frequently are able to provide high touch and specialized banking services given their unique connection to their communitiestotal bank assets as a  of gdp by country top  bank assets as a

   canada france united kingdom japan united states germany china          large banks such as jpmorganchase also have a strong local presencewe are proud to have branches and offices all across the country and to have the privilege of being woven into communities large and smallbut we respect the fact that for some customers there is no substitute for a locally based bank and that in some markets a locally based lender is the best fit for the needs of the communityhaving said that these very same regional and community banks depend on large banks such as ours to make their service offerings possiblefirst large banks offer vital correspondent banking services for smaller institutionsthese services include distributing and collecting physical cash processing checks and clearing international paymentsjpmorganchase alone extends such services to  small banks and  corporate credit unions across the countrylast year we provided these institutions with  billion in intraday credit to facilitate cash management activities and processed  trillion in paymentsreceivableslarge banks also enable community banks to provide traditional mortgages by purchasing the mortgages that smaller banks originate selling the loans to the agencies eg fannie mae or capital markets and continuing to service the borrowerin  jpmorganchase purchased  billion in such resi dential loans from  banks nationwidein addition to these correspondent banking services large banks deliver missioncritical investment banking servicesthis includes helping smaller banks access debt and equity capital supporting them through strategic combinations enabling them to manage their securities portfolios providing valuable risk management tools such as interest rate swaps and foreign exchange creating syndi cated credit facilities that smaller banks’ clients can participate in and offering direct financingjpmorganchase has raised  billion in growth equity capital for smaller banks since  advised on strategic combinations among regional and commu nity banks valued at  billion and last year provided  billion in secured repo financing extended  billion in trading line financing and provided  billion in other unsecured financing to hundreds of banks nationwidethis is a story of symbiosis among our banks rather than a binary choice between big and smallyes all banks are competitors in the marketplacebut marketplace competition is not zerosumin banking your compet itor can also be your customerlarge banks ultimately would be diminished if regional and community banks were weakened and just as surely those smaller institutions would lose out if america’s large banks were hobbledwe require a system that serves the needs of all americans from customers getting their first mortgage to farmers and small business owners to our largest multina tional companiesamerica faces enough real challenges without inventing conflict where none need existrather banks of all sizes do themselves and their stakeholders better service by acknowledging the specific value different types of institutions offerthen we all can get on with the business of serving our distinctive roles in strengthening the economy our communities and our countrybanks cannot be utilitiesutilities are monopolies ie generally only one company is operating in a marketand because of that prices and returns are regu latedbanks do not have the same relation ship with their clients as most other compa nies dowhen a customer walks into a store and wants to buy an item the store sells itby contrast very often a bank needs to turn a customer down for example in connec tion with a credit card or a loanresponsible lending is good but irresponsible lending is bad for the economy and for the client we clearly experienced this in the great recessionbanks are more like partners with their clients – and they are often active participants in their clients’ financial affairsthey frequently are in the position where they have to insist that clients operate with discipline – by asking for collateral putting   covenants in place or forcing the sale of assetsthis does not always create friends but it is critical for appropriate lending and the proper functioning of marketsbanks have to continuously make judgments on risk and appropriately price for it and they have to do this while competing for a client’s businessthere is nothing about banking that remotely resembles a utilityamerica’s financial system is the finest the world has ever seen — let’s ensure it stays that waythe position of america’s leading banks is like many other us industries – they are among the global leadersif we are not allowed to compete we will become less diversified and less efficienti do not want any american to look back in  years and try to figure out how and why america’s banks lost the leadership position in finan cial servicesif not us it will be someone else and likely a chinese banktoday many chinese banks already are larger than we are and they continue to grow rapidlythey are ambitious they are supported by their government and they have a competitive reason to go global – the chinese banks are following and supporting their chinese companies with the financial services that are required to expand abroadnot only are america’s largest banks global leaders but they help set global standards for financial markets companies and even coun tries and controls such as antimoney laun deringfinally banks bring huge resources – financial and knowledge – to america’s major flagship companies and investors thereby helping them maintain their global leadership positionswhy do you say that banks need to be steadfast and always there for their clients — doesn’t that always put you in the middle of the storm yes to an extentwhen an economy weakens banks will see it in lower busi ness volumes and higher credit lossesof course we want to manage this carefully but it is part of the cost of doing businessbuilding a banking business takes decades of training bankers nurturing relation ships opening branches and developing the proper technologyit is not like buying or selling a stockclients from consumers to countries expect you to be there in both good times and the toughest of timesbanks and their services are often the essential lifeblood to their clientstherefore it is part of the cost of doing business to manage through the cyclesjpmorganchase consistently supports consumers businesses and communities in both good times and the toughest of timesin  the firm provided  billion of credit to us small businesses which allowed them to develop new products expand operations and hire more workers  billion of credit to commercial and middle market clients  billion of credit to consumers more than  billion of credit or capital raised for nonprofit and government entities including states municipalities hospitals and universi ties and  trillion of credit or capital raised for corporationsin total we extended credit and raised capital of more than  trillion for our clientsbanks were there for their clients particularly when the capital markets were not — we need this to continuethe public markets even though they are populated with a lot of very bright and talented people are surprisingly ficklethe psychology and wisdom of crowds are not always rational and they are very imper sonalpeople who buy and sell securities do not have a moral obligation to provide credit to clientsthis is when banks’ long term relationships

securities and commercial paper once the financial crisis hitcommer cial paper outstanding alone dropped by  trillion starving companies in desperate need of cashyou can see that bank loans outstanding for the most part were steady and consistentthis means that banks continued to renew or roll over credit to their clients – small medium and large – when it was needed the mostthis will be a little bit harder to do in the future because capital liquidity and accounting rules are essentially more procy clical than they were in the pastwe esti mate that if we were to enter a very difficult market such as  our capital needs could increase bydespite the market need for credit banks would be in a position where all things being equal they would need to reduce the credit extended

                 most banks actually are trusted by their clients but generically they are notthis dichotomy also is true with politicians lawyers and the media – people trust the individuals they know but when it comes to whether people trust them as a group they do notwe believe that the only way to be restored to a position of trust is to earn it every day in every community and with every clientthe reality is that banks because of the disci plined role they sometimes have to play and the need to say no in some instances will not always be the best of friends with some of their clientsbut banks still need to discharge that responsibility while continuing to regain a position of trust in societythere is no easy simple answer other than • maintain steadfast consistent and trans parent behavior wherever they operate • communicate honestly clearly and consistently • deliver great products and services • admitting to mistakes is good fixing them is better and learning from them is essential • make it easy for customers to deal with you – particularly when they have problems • work with customers who are struggling – both individuals and companies • focus on the customer and treat all clients the way you would want to be treated • be great citizens in the communityestablish strong relationships with govern ments and civic society • treat regulators like full partners – and accept that you will not always agreewhen they make a change in regulations even ones you don’t like accept them and move on • as an industry make fewer mistakes and behave better – the bad behavior of one individual reverberates and affects the entire industryfinally strong regulators and stronger standards for banks must ultimately mean that banks are meeting more rigorous stan dardsevery bank is doing everything in its power to meet regulatory standardsit has been eight years since the financial crisis and six years since doddfrankregulators should take more credit for the extraordi nary amount that has been accomplished and should state this clearly to the american publicthis should help improve consumer confidence in the banking system – and in the economy in generalconsumer and business confidence is the secret sauce for a healthy economyit is free and it would be good to sprinkle a bit more of it aroundare you and your regulators thinking more comprehensively and in a forwardlooking way to play a role in helping to accelerate global growth by any reasonable measure the financial system is unquestionably stronger and regu lators deserve a lot of credit for thisbut it also is true that thousands of rules regula tions and requirements were made – and needed to be made – quicklythe political and regulatory side wanted it done swiftly to ensure that events that happened in the great recession would never happen againbut now is the time when we can and should look at everything more deliberately and assess whether recent reforms have generated unintended consequences that merit attentionsome people speak of regulation like it is a simple binary tradeoff – a stronger system or slower growth or vice versawe believe that many times you can come up with regulations that do both – create a stronger system and enhance growthwill banks ever regain a position of trust how will this be done   there will be a time to comprehensively review coordinate and modify regulations to ensure maximum safety create more efficiency and accelerate economic growthevery major piece of legislation in the united states that was large and complex has been revisited at some point with the intention of making it betterthe political time for this is not now but we should do so for banking regulations somedaywe are not looking to rewrite or to start over at all – just some modifications that make sensehere are a few specific examples • liquidityregulators could give them selves more tools for adjusting liquidity to accommodate market needsthis could be done with modest changes that could actually ameliorate the procyclical nature of the current rules and in my opinion enhance safety and soundness and improve the economy • mortgagesfinishing and simplifying mort gage rules around origination servicing capital requirements and securitizations would help create a more active mortgage market at a lower cost to customers and again at no risk to safety and soundness if done rightthis too would be a plus to consumers and the economy • capital ruleswithout reducing total capital levels capital rules could be modified to be less procyclical which could serve to both dampen a bubble and soften a bustthis alone could boost the economy and reduce overall economic riskthere are also some rules – for example requiring that capital be held against a deposit at the federal reserve – that distort the normal functioning of the marketthese could be eliminated with no risk to safety and soundness unless you think the fed is a risky investmentfinally finishing the capital rules for banks will remove one additional drag on the banks and allow for more consistent capital planningthis would also help to improve confidence in the banks and by extension investor confidence • increased coordination among regulatorshaving five six or seven regulators involved in every issue does make things more complicated expensive and inef ficient not just for banks but for regula tors toothis slows policymaking and rulemaking and is one reason why many of the rules still have not been completedone of the lessons we have all learned is that policymakers need to move quickly in a crisiswhile everyone has worked hard to be more coordinated far more can be done • be more forward lookingthis is already happeningas banks are catching up on regulatory demands the pace of change while still rapid is slowingthis sets the stage for both banks and regulators to be able to devote more resources to increas ingly critical issues including cyberse curity digital services data protection fintech and emerging risksas the financial system reaches the level of strength that regulations require we hope banks can begin to expand slightly more rapidly and of course responsibly – both geographically and in terms of products and services – with the support and confidence of their regulatorsthis will also foster healthy economic growth which we all so desperately want   viigood public policy is critically important are you worried about bad public policy yes bad public policy and i’m not looking at this in a partisan way creates risk for the economies of the world and the living standards of the people on this planet – and therefore for the future of jpmorganchase – more so than credit or market riskswe have many reallife examples that demonstrate how essential good public policy is to the health and welfare of a countryeast germany vswest germanyafter world war ii east germany and west germany were in equal positions both having been devastated by the warafter the war west germany flourished creating a vibrant and healthy country for its citizenseast germany and in fact most of eastern europe operating under different gover nance and policies was a complete disasterthis did not have to be the caseeast germany could have been just as successful as west germanythis is a perfect example of how important policy is and also of how economics is not a zerosum gameargentina venezuela cuba north korea vssingapore south korea mexicothese coun tries also provide us with some pretty strong contraststhe first four countries mentioned above have performed poorly economicallythe last three mentioned above have done rather well in the last several decadesyou cannot credit this failure or success to the existence of great natural resources because on both sides some had these resources and some did notit would take too long to articulate it fully here but strong public policy – fiscal monetary social etc – made all the differencethe countries that did not perform well had many reasons to be successful but they were notin almost all these cases their government took ineffec tive actions in the name of the peopledetroitdetroit is an example of failure at the city levelin the last  years most american cities had a renaissance – detroit did notdetroit was a train wreck in slow motion for  yearsthe city had unsustainable finances corrupt government and a declining population that went from  million resi dents to just overit is tragic that this catastrophe had to happen before government started to rectify the situationwe have reported that we are making a huge investment in detroit and we are doing this because the leadership – the demo cratic mayor and the republican governor working with business and nonprofit orga nizations – is taking rational and practical action in detroit to fix the city’s problemsthese leaders talk about strengthening the police improving schools bringing jobs back creating affordable housing fixing streetlights and rehabilitating neighborhoods – real things that actually matter and will help the people of detroitthey do not couch their agenda in sanctimonious ideologyfannie mae and freddie macthese are examples of poor policy at the industry and company levelunder government auspices and with federal government urging fannie and freddie became the largest most lever aged and most speculative vehicles that the world had ever seenand when they finally collapsed they cost the us government  billiontheir actions were a critical part of the failure of the mortgage market which was at the heart of the great reces sionmany people spent time trying to figure out who was to blame more – the banks and mortgage brokers involved or fannie and freddiehere is a better course – each should have acknowledged its mistakes and deter mined what could have been done betterso yes public policy is critical to a healthy and functioning economynow i’d like to turn my attention to a more forwardlooking view of some of the potential risks out there today that are driven by public policy   our current inability to work together in addressing important longterm issueswe have spoken many times about the extraor dinarily positive and resilient american economytoday it is growing stronger and it is far better than you hear in the current polit ical discoursebut we have serious issues that we need to address – even the united states does not have a divine right to successi won’t go into a lot of detail but will list only some key concerns the longterm fiscal and tax issues driven mostly by healthcare and social security costs as well as complex and poorly designed corporate and individual taxes immigration education especially in inner city schools and the need for good long term infrastructure plansi am not pointing fingers at the government in particular for our inability to act because it is all of us as us citizens who need to face these problemsi do not believe that these issues will cause a crisis in the next five to  years and unfor tunately this may lull us into a false sense of securitybut after  years it will become clear that action will need to be takenthe problem is not that the us economy won’t be able to take care of its citizens – it is that taking away benefits creating intergenera tional warfare and scapegoating will make for very difficult and bad politicsthis is a tragedy that we can see comingearly action would be relatively painlessthe potential exit of britain from the european union brexitone can reasonably argue that britain is better untethered to the bureau cratic and sometimes dysfunctional european unionthis may be true in the long run but let’s analyze the riskswe mostly know what it looks like if britain stays in the european union – effectively a continuation of a more predictable environmentbut the range of outcomes of a brexit is large and potentially unknownthe best case is that britain can quickly renegotiate hundreds of trade and other contracts with countries around the world including the european unioneven this scenario will result in years of uncer tainty and this uncertainty will hurt the economies of both britain and the european unionin a bad scenario and this is not the worstcase scenario trade retaliation against britain by countries in the european union is possible even though this would not be in their own selfinterestretaliation would make things even worse for the british and european economiesand it is hard to deter mine if the longrun impact would strengthen the european union or cause it to break apartthe european union began with a collective resolve to establish a political union and peace after centuries of devastating wars and to create a common market that would result in a better economy and greater pros perity for its citizensthese two goals still exist and they are still worth striving forwe need a proper public policy response to technology trade and globalizationtechnology and globalization are the best things that ever happened to mankind but we need to help those left behindtechnology is what has driven progress for all mankindwithout it we all would be living in tents hunting buffalo and hoping to live to agefrom printing which resulted in the dissemina tion of information to agriculture and to today’s computers and healthcare – it’s an astounding phenomenon – and the next  years will be just as astoundingthe world and most people benefit enor mously from innovative ideas however some people some communities and some sectors in our economy do notas we embrace progress we need to recog nize that technology and globalization can impact labor markets negatively create job displacement and contribute to the pay disparity between the skilled and unskilledpolitical and business leaders have fallen short in not only acknowledging these chal lenges but in dealing with them head onwe need to support solutions that address the displacement of workers and communi ties through better job training relocation support and income assistancesome have suggested that dramatically expanding the earned income tax credit effectively paying people to work may create a healthy and more egalitarian societyalso we must address an education system that fails millions of young people who live in poor communities throughout the united states   the answer to these challenges is not to hold back progress and the magic of tech nology the answer is to deal with the facts and ensure that public policy and public and private enterprise contribute to a healthy functioning and inclusive economyat jpmorganchase we are trying to contribute to the debate on public policyone new way we are doing this is through the development of our jpmorganchase institute which aims to support sounder economic and public policy through better facts timely data and thoughtful analysisour work at the institute whether analyzing income and consumption volatility small businesses local spending by consumers or the impact of low gas prices aims to inform policymakers businesses and nonprofit leaders and help them make smarter deci sions to advance global prosperitywhat works and what doesn’t workin my job i am fortunate to be able to travel around the world and to meet presidents prime ministers chief executive officers nonprofit directors and other influential civic leadersall of them want a better future for their country and their peoplewhat i have learned from them is that while politics is hard in my view much harder than busi ness breeding mistrust and misunder standing makes the political environment far worsenearly always collaboration rational thinking and analysis make the situation bettersolutions are not always easy to find but they almost always are therewhat doesn’t work • treating every decision like it is binary – my way or your waymost decisions are not binary and there are usually better answers waiting to be found if you do the analysis and involve the right people • drawing straw men or creating scape goatsthese generally are subtle attempts to oversimplify someone’s position in order to attack it resulting in anger misunderstanding and mistrust • denigrating a whole class of people or societythis is always wrong and just another form of prejudiceone of the greatest men in america’s history presi dent abraham lincoln never drew straw men never scapegoated and never deni grated any class of society – even though he probably had more reason to do so than manyin the same breath some of our politicians can extol his virtues while violating them • equating perception with realitythis is a tough one because you have to deal with both perceptions and realityhowever perceptions that are real are completely different from perceptions that are falseand how you deal with each of them prob ably should differ • treating someone’s comments as if they were complaintswhen someone’s response to an issue raised is “here they go complaining again” that reaction diminishes the point of view and also diminishes the personwhen a person complains you need to ask the question “are they right or are they wrong” if you don’t like the person’s attitude that is a different matter what does work • collaborating and compromisingthey are a necessity in a democracyalso you can compromise without violating your principles but it is nearly impossible to compromise when you turn principles into ideology • listening carefully to each othermake an effort to understand when someone is right and acknowledge iteach of us should read and listen to great thinkers who have an alternative point of view • constantly openly and thoroughly reviewing institutions programs and policiesanalyze what is working and what is not working and then figure out – together – how we can make it better   i am honored to work at this company and with its outstanding peoplewhat they have accomplished during these often difficult circumstances has been extraordinaryi know that if you could see our people up close in action you would join me in expressing deep gratitude to themi am proud to be their partner

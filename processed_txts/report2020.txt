Jamie Dimon,  
Chairman and  
Chief Executive Officer
Dear Fellow Shareholders,
2020 was an extraordinary year by any measure. It was a year of a global 
pandemic, a global recession, unprecedented government actions, turbulent  
elections, and deeply felt social and racial injustice. It was a year in which each of 
us faced difficult personal challenges, and a staggering number of us lost loved 
ones. It was also a year when those among us with less were disproportionately 
hurt by joblessness and poverty. And it was a time when companies discovered 
what they really were and, sometimes, what they might become. 
Watching events unfold throughout the year, we were keenly focused on what we, 
as a company, could do to serve. As I begin this annual letter to shareholders,  
I am proud of what our company and our tens of thousands of employees around 
the world achieved, collectively and individually. As you know, we have long cham-
pioned the essential role of banking in a community — its potential for bringing 
people together, for enabling companies and individuals to reach for their dreams, 
3
and for being a source of strength in difficult times. Those opportunities were 
powerfully presented to us this year, and I am proud of how we stepped up.  
I discuss these themes later in this letter. 
As I look back on the last year and the last two decades — starting from my time 
as CEO of Bank One in 2000 — it is remarkable how much we persevered and have 
accomplished, not only in terms of financial performance but also in our stead-
fast dedication to help clients, communities and countries throughout the world. 
2020 was another strong year for JPMorgan Chase, with the firm generating record 
revenue, as well as numerous other records in each of our lines of business. We 
earned $29.1 billion in net income on revenue of $122.9 billion versus $36.4 billion 
on revenue of $118.5 billion in 2019, reflecting strong underlying performance across 
our businesses offset by additional reserves under new accounting rules. We gener-
ally grew market share across our businesses and continued to make significant 
investments in products, people and technology, all while maintaining credit  
discipline and a fortress balance sheet. In total, we extended credit and raised  
$2.3 trillion in capital for businesses, institutional clients and U.S. customers.
JPMorgan Chase stock is owned by large institutions, pension plans, mutual funds 
and directly by individual investors. However, it is important to remember that 
in almost all cases, the ultimate beneficiaries are the individuals in our commu-
nities. More than 100 million people in the United States own stock, and a large 
percentage of these individuals, in one way or another, own JPMorgan Chase stock. 
Many of these people are veterans, teachers, police officers, firefighters, health-
care workers, retirees or those saving for a home, school or retirement. Your 
management team goes to work every day recognizing the enormous responsibility 
that we have to perform for our shareholders. 
While we don’t run the company worrying about the stock price in the short run, in 
the long run our stock price is a measure of the progress we have made over the 
years. This progress is a function of continual investments in our people, systems 
and products, in good and bad times, to build our capabilities. Whether looking

These charts show actual returns of the stock, with dividends reinvested, for heritage shareholders of Bank One and JPMorgan Chase & Co. 
vs. the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500 Index) and the Standard & Poor’s Financials Index (S&P Financials Index).
1 On March 27, 2000, Jamie Dimon was hired as CEO of Bank One.

back over five years, 10 years or since the JPMorgan Chase/Bank One merger 
(approximately 15 years ago), these investments mean our stock has significantly 
outperformed the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and the Standard & Poor’s  
Financials Index. These important investments will also drive our company’s  
future prospects and position it to grow and prosper for decades.
We have consistently described to you, our shareholders, the basic principles and 
strategies we use to build this company — from maintaining a fortress balance 
sheet, constantly investing, nurturing talent, fully satisfying regulators, and  
continually improving risk, governance and controls to serving customers and 
clients while lifting up communities worldwide. 
Adhering to these principles allows us to drive good organic growth and prop-
erly manage our capital (including dividends and stock buybacks), which we have 
consistently demonstrated over the past decades. All of this is shown in the charts 
in this introduction. In addition, we urge you to read the CEO letters in this Annual 
Report, which will give you a lot more specific detail about our businesses and what 
our plans are for the future.

If you look deeper, you will find that our success and accomplishments are founded 
on our commitment to our shareholders. Shareholder value can be built only if you 
maintain a healthy and vibrant company, which means doing a good job taking care 
of your customers, employees and communities. Conversely, how can you have a 
healthy company if you neglect any of these stakeholders? As we have learned in 
2020, there are myriad ways an institution can demonstrate its compassion for its 
employees and its communities while still upholding shareholder value.
Ultimately, the basis of our success is our people. They are the ones who serve our 
customers and communities, build the technology, make the strategic decisions, 
manage the risks, determine our investments and drive innovation. Whatever your 
view is of the world’s complexity and the risks and opportunities ahead, having a 
great team of people — with guts and brains and enormous capabilities who can 
navigate personally challenging circumstances while dedicating themselves to 
professional excellence — is what ensures our prosperity, now and in the future.

Business Roundtable’s Statement on the 
Purpose of a Corporation 
In August 2019, Business Roundtable released the below Statement on the 
Purpose of a Corporation, signed by 181 CEOs, including Jamie Dimon, then 
chair of the association. This statement repositioned the definition of corporate 
success as serving shareholders principally to endorsing a modern standard 
of corporate responsibility: to serve all stakeholders — customers, employees, 
suppliers, communities and shareholders. 
Americans deserve an economy that allows each person to succeed through 
hard work and creativity and to lead a life of meaning and dignity. We believe 
the free-market system is the best means of generating good jobs, a strong 
and sustainable economy, innovation, a healthy environment and economic 
opportunity for all. 
Businesses play a vital role in the economy by creating jobs, fostering 
innovation and providing essential goods and services. Businesses make and 
sell consumer products; manufacture equipment and vehicles; support the 
national defense; grow and produce food; provide health care; generate and 
deliver energy; and offer financial, communications and other services that 
underpin economic growth. 
While each of our individual companies serves its own corporate purpose, we 
share a fundamental commitment to all of our stakeholders. We commit to: 
• 
Delivering value to our customers. We will further the tradition of American 
companies leading the way in meeting or exceeding customer expectations. 
• 
Investing in our employees. This starts with compensating them fairly and 
providing important benefits. It also includes supporting them through 
training and education that help develop new skills for a rapidly changing 
world. We foster diversity and inclusion, dignity and respect. 
• 
Dealing fairly and ethically with our suppliers. We are dedicated to serving 
as good partners to the other companies, large and small, that help us 
meet our missions. 
• 
Supporting the communities in which we work. We respect the people in 
our communities and protect the environment by embracing sustainable 
practices across our businesses. 
• 
Generating long-term value for shareholders, who provide the capital 
that allows companies to invest, grow and innovate. We are committed to 
transparency and effective engagement with shareholders. 
Each of our stakeholders is essential. We commit to deliver value to all of them, 
for the future success of our companies, our communities and our country.

I. THE CORPORATE CITIZEN:  
 
THE PURPOSE OF A CORPORATION
We need to build and maintain a healthy 
and vibrant company, over the long run, 
to be able to deal with the uncertainties of 
life, to invest, to innovate and to grow. To 
be healthy and vibrant, a company must do 
many things well: It must do a great job for 
customers; attract, develop and retain talented 
employees; and serve its communities. 
It is vital that we do all of these things, 
as the failure to perform any one of them 
with excellence could lead to the failure 
of all. Over the years, we have extensively 
described the efforts we make to take care 
of our customers and our employees. The 
purpose of this section is to describe our 
corporate responsibility efforts in more detail 
and explain their importance. 
To be healthy and vibrant – and to create long-
term shareholder value – a company must be 
financially successful over the long run. 
The problem with the American public’s 
impression of “shareholder value” is that too 
many people interpret it to mean short-term, 
rapacious profit taking – which, ironically, 
is the last thing that leads to building real, 
long-term shareholder value. And when they 
hear the word “fiduciary,” they think we are 
standing behind our lawyers. 
Obviously, companies have fiduciary respon-
sibilities. However, legal and fiduciary 
language does not represent how most CEOs 
and boards actually run their companies. 
We should not be buttonholed by the debate 
about whether there are “fiduciary” reasons 
to think of “shareholder value” narrowly 
and to the exclusion of those who work at 
the company, our clients and communi-
ties. When most CEOs and board members 
wake up each morning, they worry about all 
of the things that they need to do right to 
build a successful company. A company is 
like a team. We must do many things well 
to succeed, and, ultimately, that leads to 
creating shareholder value.
1. Businesses must earn the trust of their customers and communities by acting ethically 
and morally.
To a good company, its reputation is every-
thing. That reputation is earned day in and 
day out with every interaction with customers 
and communities. This is not to say that 
companies (and people) do not make mistakes 
– of course they do. Often a reputation is 
earned by how you deal with those mistakes. 
While all businesses are different, there are 
some fundamentals: good products, fair and 
transparent pricing, thoughtful and respon-
sive service, and continuous innovation. 
Great companies constantly set high stan-
dards, acknowledge their mistakes and prop-
erly discipline or dismiss bad actors. 
Great companies are strict about having fair 
dealings with their customers. I have always 
loved that Home Depot’s company policy 
is not to raise lumber prices in the imme-
diate aftermath of a hurricane, regardless 
of whether it can. (I want to remind readers 
that banks essentially did not raise the price 
of credit when they renewed loans during 
the financial crisis.) Pricing to customers 
should be what’s fair – not what a company 
can get away with. 
Banks, in particular, have to be rigorous 
about standards. Unlike many companies 
that will simply sell you a product if you 
can pay for it, banks must necessarily turn 
14
I.  THE CORPORATE CITIZEN: THE PURPOSE OF A CORPORATION 
customers down or enforce rules that a 
customer may not like (for example, cove-
nants). This makes open and transparent 
dealings even more important. When I hear 
examples of people doing something that 
is wrong because they could be paid more, 
it makes my blood boil – and I don’t want 
them working here. And I can’t believe it 
when I hear about a company, or a hedge 
fund, causing loans and a company to default 
so they can trigger credit default swap 
hedges – it’s completely unethical.
We must always strive, particularly in tough 
times, to earn the trust of our customers and 
communities. 
If you live in a small town and run a corner 
bakery, it is very easy to understand the 
value of being a responsible community 
citizen. Most businesses on “Main Street” 
keep the sidewalk in front of their store 
clean so people don’t slip and fall. They often 
participate in the community by supporting 
local sports teams or religious institutions. 
A bakery or a restaurant will often donate 
surplus food at the end of the day to a local 
homeless shelter. Most businesses under-
stand that everyone doing their part to 
make the community a better place is both 
the moral thing to do and a driver of better 
commercial outcomes for the town.
When JPMorgan Chase enters a community, 
we take great pride in being a responsible 
citizen at the local level – just like the local 
bakery. We lend to and support local busi-
nesses. We help customers with banking, 
lending and saving. And our local corpo-
rate responsibility efforts and philanthropic 
programs (examples of which are described 
in the following features in this section) help 
make these communities stronger. 
2. Being a responsible community citizen locally is critical, and it is easy to understand why.
3. Being a responsible community citizen nationally, or globally, is more critical and  
more complex. 
Most people consider corporate responsi-
bility to be merely enhanced philanthropy. 
This is understandable. But it is far harder 
to understand what being a responsible 
community citizen means in terms of macro 
corporate responsibility. While we are 
devoted to philanthropy – we spend $330 
million a year on these efforts – corporate 
responsibility is far more than that.
JPMorgan Chase takes an active role in 
large-scale public policy issues. We are 
fully engaged in trying to solve some of 
the world’s biggest issues – climate change, 
poverty, economic development and racial 
inequality – and the accompanying features 
that follow describe the extensive efforts we 
are making. With well-designed policies, we 
think these problems can all be solved. In 
the last section of this letter, I detail certain 
policy issues, which – if forcefully and 
effectively addressed – would be great for 
America and the world at large. We engage 
at this level because companies (like ours) 
have an extraordinary capability to help. We 
help not just with funding but with devel-
oping strong public policy, which can have 
a greater impact on society than the collec-
tive effect of companies that are respon-
sible community citizens locally. This year, 
for example, our PolicyCenter published 
research based on the actual experiences of 
our customers and communities, showing 
how new policies could drive a more inclu-
sive economic recovery and help small 
businesses. JPMorgan Chase has always 
recognized that long-term business success 
depends on community success, and that is 
15
I.  THE CORPORATE CITIZEN: THE PURPOSE OF A CORPORATION 
one of the reasons for our enduring achieve-
ment. When everyone has a fair shot at 
participating – and sharing – in the rewards 
of growth, the economy will be stronger, and 
our society will be better. 
We also believe that businesses’ extraordi-
nary capabilities are even more powerful 
when put to use in collaboration with 
governments’ capabilities, particularly when 
seeking to solve our biggest economic and 
societal ills at the local level. As Washington, 
D.C., and central governments around the 
world struggle with partisan gridlock and 
an inability to get big things done, local 
communities are coming up with some of 
the best ideas to make civic society work for 
more people. Mayors, governors, educators, 
major employers, entrepreneurs, community 
leaders and nonprofits are making serious 
progress developing innovative approaches 
that address our greatest challenges, but their 
work often flies under the radar. We must 
elevate these thoughtful ideas and find ways 
to share them with others facing similar situ-
ations, enabling more communities to benefit 
from proven, localized solutions. After busi-
nesses have had success with some of these 
efforts locally, they can be adopted across the 
country and, in fact, around the world. 
Our effort is substantial and permanent and has 
support throughout the company.
Importantly, these civic efforts are supported 
by senior leadership and are managed by 
some of our best people (these initiatives are 
not an afterthought and are sustainable). For 
our part, we are making significant, long-
term, data-driven business and philanthropic 
investments. And while we try to be creative, 
we analyze everything, including philan-
thropy, based on measurable results.
Executing Our Corporate Purpose 
 
We go to great lengths to be there for our clients, customers, employees and communities. Moreover, 
this unwavering commitment has been a hallmark of our company since its founding. During this time of 
corporate self-reflection, it’s important to understand and reaffirm the magnitude of our contributions. 
Helping Clients and Customers in 2020
• 
We extended credit and raised capital totaling 
$2.3 trillion for consumers and clients of all 
sizes around the world, including some of the 
industries and communities most affected by 
the pandemic’s economic fallout. This includes 
critical financing for companies such as Boeing 
and its 145,000 employees. J.P. Morgan helped 
them raise $25 billion to help fund their ongoing 
operations as the pandemic led to less air travel.
• 
We provided consumers with $226 billion in 
credit to help them afford some of their most 
important purchases, including new homes and 
vehicles. This included more than $32 billion to 
help customers in underserved communities 
purchase a new home.
• 
We raised $1.1 trillion in capital for corporations 
and non-U.S. government entities and offered 
$865 billion in credit for corporations. For 
example, we helped Meals on Wheels build a 
new 36,000-square-foot commercial kitchen 
and food production facility to help maintain 
good nutritional health of older adults with 
limited financial resources.
• 
We raised $103 billion in credit and capital for 
nonprofit and U.S. government entities, including 
states, cities, hospitals and universities. This 
included funding for NewYork-Presbyterian 
Health System — which saw a significant increase 
in patients as a result of COVID-19 — to help them 
acquire vital medical supplies and equipment 
and to bring on additional staff. 
16
• 
We committed more than $45 billion in lending 
and investments to support community 
development, affordable housing and small 
business growth in underserved communities 
across the United States. This included Eden 
Housing, a nonprofit that provides low-income 
residents with safe, modern and affordable 
housing in California’s Bay Area. 
• 
We provided more than $18 billion in credit to 
small businesses around the country, as well 
as more than $32 billion in funding ($28 billion 
excluding Small Business Administration (SBA) 
safe harbor refunds) under the SBA’s Paycheck 
Protection Program (PPP). For example, we 
helped Kids Klub Child Development Centers — 
which offer preschool, daycare and after-school 
programming — revamp their centers to enable 
care for essential workers’ children. 
• 
We provided critical development financing 
and attracted additional investment, such 
as funding through our new development 
finance institution (DFI) to support sustainable 
development. In 2020, the DFI mobilized 
$140 billion toward these goals — helping, for 
example, with Uzbekistan’s first local currency 
issuance in international markets to finance 
the country’s health, education and transport 
sectors and with the Republic of Georgia’s 
debut green bond to support that country’s 
access to water, power and sanitation. 
• 
We raised $12 billion in capital and credit to 
help finance infrastructure projects across 
the United States. This included $1.3 billion 
in credit assistance to New York City’s 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority to help 
deal with the serious impacts of COVID-19 on 
the city’s transportation system and $800 
million in capital for Michigan’s Department of 
Transportation to help rebuild the state’s roads 
and bridges. 
• 
We designed branches, products, services 
and digital solutions to help clients and 
customers better manage their financial daily 
lives, with particular focus on underserved 
communities and families. Examples include 
low-cost, low-fee accounts, such as Chase 
Secure BankingSM, and financial tools, such 
as Chase Credit Journey and Chase Autosave. 
In 2020, we continued to open new branches 
in new markets across the United States with 
30% opening in low- to moderate-income 
communities by 2023. 
Helping Communities
• 
We have supported and continue to support a 
range of community initiatives — from assisting 
underserved small businesses outside of Paris 
to facilitating skills training for high-growth 
jobs in India to helping residents of Harlem 
increase savings and reduce debt. In 2020, we 
provided more than $500 million in low-cost 
loans, equity and philanthropic grants to 
address immediate needs brought on by the 
COVID-19 crisis, drive an inclusive recovery 
and advance racial equity. These efforts will 
help 1.3 million individuals receive financial 
coaching, enable 172,000 people to enroll in 
jobs and skills training programs, assist 64,000 
underserved small businesses and create or 
preserve 43,000 affordable housing units. 
• 
We have committed employee time and talent 
to tackling communities’ greatest challenges. 
In 2020, employees participated in nearly 
50 Service Corps programs to help local 
nonprofits; mentored hundreds of Black and 
Latinx young men as part of The Fellowship 
Initiative; and supported local organizations 
focused on racial equity. 
• 
We are dedicated to addressing climate change 
and sustainability around the world. In 2020, 
the firm committed to finance and facilitate 
$200 billion to drive action on climate change 
and advance sustainable development, 
including renewable energy, cleaner water 
and waste management; improve access 
to housing, education and healthcare; and 
promote infrastructure, innovation and growth 
around the globe. 
17
Supporting Employees
• 
We have taken extensive steps to support our 
employees, who are our greatest strength. 
We offer 300 accredited skills and education 
programs and have helped 15,000 employees 
(to date) assess their skills, which may lead 
to opportunities for career mobility at the 
firm. And we have been increasing wages for 
thousands of employees, including branch and 
customer service employees, to between $16 
and $20 an hour, depending on where they 
work in the United States, while providing an 
annual benefits package worth about $13,000. 
• 
As part of our strategy to diversify our talent 
pipeline, we have implemented a range of 
changes to expand opportunities for individuals 
with a criminal background. In 2020, we hired 
approximately 2,100 people with a criminal 
background — roughly 10% of our new hires in 
the United States. And through the JPMorgan 
Chase PolicyCenter, we are advancing federal 
and state policies that help qualified workers 
with an arrest or conviction record compete 
for employment in federal agencies and with 
federal contractors. We are reforming Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) hiring 
rules and setting up automatic record clearing 
for eligible offenses to help individuals move on 
from their record. We also supported a measure 
signed into federal law in 2020 restoring access 
to Pell Grants for incarcerated individuals, 
which allows them to pursue postsecondary 
education in prison and increase employment 
opportunities after their release.
Our $30 Billion Path Forward Commitment 
 
JPMorgan Chase introduced The Path Forward in October 2020, committing $30 billion over the next five 
years to address the key drivers of the racial wealth divide, reduce systemic racism against Black and 
Latinx people, and support employees. The firm has made tangible progress to date.
Promote and expand affordable housing and homeownership for underserved communities
• 
Helping Black and Latinx families buy 
homes and refinance loans: Our Home 
Lending business has committed to helping an 
additional 40,000 Black and Latinx families 
buy a home over the next five years, with the 
firm dedicating $8 billion in mortgages for 
this purpose. The firm is committing up to $4 
billion in refinancing loans to help an additional 
20,000 Black and Latinx households achieve 
lower mortgage payments. In addition, the 
firm is working to improve key home lending 
products and offerings: A $5,000 grant, for 
example, will help cover closing costs and down 
payments for people buying a home in 6,700 
minority communities in the United States.
• 
Expanding affordable housing in underserved 
communities: The firm’s inaugural $1 billion 
social bond builds on its strategy to use its 
business expertise to create opportunity 
for underserved communities. The bond’s 
co-managers solely comprise minority- and 
women-owned businesses, as well as service-
disabled, veteran-owned firms.
18
Grow Black- and Latinx-owned businesses
• 
Helping small businesses thrive: A $350 
million, five-year global commitment 
underscores our dedication to grow Black-, 
Latinx- and women-owned businesses among 
other underserved small businesses, help 
address the racial wealth divide and create 
a more inclusive recovery from the COVID-19 
pandemic. This ambitious endeavor combines 
low-cost loans, equity investments and 
philanthropy and will help reduce barriers to 
capital for underserved small businesses to 
support their immediate needs and long-term 
growth. As part of this commitment, the firm 
is investing $42.5 million in low-cost loans and 
philanthropy to expand the Entrepreneurs of 
Color Fund to more cities in the United States, 
in collaboration with Local Initiatives Support 
Corporation and a network of community 
development financial institutions (CDFI).
• 
Investing in middle-market businesses: 
The firm is co-investing up to $200 million 
alongside Ariel Alternatives and Project Black, 
an initiative that aims to close the racial wealth 
gap by investing in middle-market businesses 
that are minority-owned — or will become 
minority-owned — to develop a new class of 
Black and Latinx entrepreneurs.
• 
Expanding our business with Black and Latinx 
suppliers: The firm’s internal Buy Black and 
Latinx Portal, led by Advancing Black Pathways, 
encourages our lines of business to purchase 
goods and services from diverse businesses. 
This year-long campaign is designed to support 
the firm’s commitment to spend $750 million 
with Black- and Latinx-owned suppliers over the 
next five years.
• 
Strengthening diverse-led financial 
institutions: To promote financial institutions in 
underserved neighborhoods, we are providing 
additional access to capital, connections to 
institutional investors through new products 
and services, specialty support for Black-led 
commercial projects, and mentorship and 
training opportunities. In October 2020, the 
firm committed to investing $50 million in 
Black- and Latinx-led minority depository 
institutions and CDFIs. With $40 million of that 
investment already committed or deployed to 
Louisiana-based Liberty Bank, North Carolina-
based M&F Bank, New York-based Carver 
Federal Savings Bank and Los Angeles-based 
Broadway Federal Bank, the total investment 
has been increased to $75 million, which could 
generate access to as much as $750 million 
in community lending. In addition, the firm’s 
new Empower money market share class will 
allow these institutions to develop new revenue 
streams by serving institutional clients. 
Improve financial health and access to banking in Black and Latinx communities
• 
Helping 1 million people open low-cost 
checking or savings accounts: Chase will open 
16 new community branches in traditionally 
underserved neighborhoods and hire 150 
community managers by 2022. Branches in 
Chicago, Dallas, Minneapolis and New York 
(Harlem) have already been redesigned under 
this new model. This model has expanded 
outreach to local small businesses — and to 
consumers with financial education — and serves 
as a hub for overall community engagement. 
Another 100 new branches are being opened in 
low- to moderate-income communities across 
the United States as part of the firm’s market 
expansion initiative. We want to build trust in 
the communities we serve and become our 
customers’ primary bank. We offer Secure 
Banking — a low-cost, no overdraft checking 
account — for those new to banking, those who 
have had trouble getting or keeping a bank 
account, and for Black and Latinx unbanked and 
underbanked households, thereby expanding 
access to traditional banking.
19
Our Sustainability Efforts 
Climate change is a critical issue of our time. 
Reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions — the 
main cause of climate change — requires collective 
ambition and cooperation across the public and 
private sectors. 
Coal, oil and natural gas — the primary sources of 
GHG emissions — have powered the world’s energy 
economy for many decades, advancing significant 
economic growth and social development for 
billions around the world. But our reliance on 
these resources now threatens the very growth 
they have enabled. 
The challenge we face is significant. While 
continuing to generate power for all of our needs, 
big and small — lighting and heating our homes, 
commuting to work, and charging our phones and 
computers, as well as operating manufacturing 
facilities that produce goods used around the 
world each day — we also need to bring energy to 
the nearly 800 million people who still don’t have 
reliable access to electricity. And we need to find a 
way to do all of these things while setting a path for 
achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.
The fact is we’re long past debating whether 
climate change is real. But we need to acknowledge 
that the solution is not as simple as walking away 
from fossil fuels. We will need resources such as 
oil and natural gas until commercial, affordable 
and low-carbon alternatives can be developed to 
meet all of our global energy needs. This is where 
business and government leaders need to focus 
their time and attention. 
While wind and solar technologies have made 
huge strides, they’re principally deployed for 
electricity generation. We don’t have clean 
alternatives for industrial and manufacturing 
energy needs, for example. Nor do we yet have 
solutions for heavy transportation, such as 
trucking and air travel. What’s more, the projected 
growth of technologies like electric vehicles is 
going to place huge pressures on the need for rare 
earth minerals — which also presents geopolitical 
and environmental challenges. 
Policymakers have taken some important steps. 
The Paris Agreement is one such success, but we 
must put a price on carbon. A carbon tax (with a 
commensurate carbon dividend — directly returned 
to the people) is an excellent way to dramatically 
reduce carbon while investing in communities most 
adversely affected by this much-needed transition. 
Without a benchmark like this, businesses and 
economies won’t be able to properly factor the 
cost of carbon and the benefit of alternatives into 
their long-term strategic planning and capital 
investment decisions. 
Companies are figuring out how to manage amid 
these challenges. And many are also dealing with 
a growing chorus of pressure from customers, 
regulators, shareholders and activists with strong 
perspectives on how corporations and other 
institutions should address climate change.
When we cut through all the noise, here’s what 
we know to be true:
Traditional energy resources play an essential 
role in our global economy today. We can agree 
on the need to make our energy system much less 
carbon intensive. But abandoning companies that 
produce and consume these fuels is not a solution. 
Furthermore, it’s economically counterproductive. 
Instead, we must work with them.
There’s huge opportunity in sustainable and 
low-carbon technologies and businesses. While 
many of these technologies and companies are 
mature, many more are just getting started — 
and more will need to be created in the coming 
decades. In addition, all companies will need 
capital and advice to help them innovate, 
evolve and become more efficient while staying 
competitive in a changing world.
This is why we made a commitment in 2020 to 
align our financing activities in three carbon-
intensive sectors — oil and gas, electric power 
and automotive manufacturing — with the Paris 
Agreement. 
To do so, we will measure our clients’ carbon 
performance against sector-based GHG reduction 
targets that we’re setting for 2030 — with the goal 
of helping them reduce emissions from their direct 
operations and, in the case of oil and gas and 
automotive companies, reduce GHGs from the use 
of their products.
20
The key metric we plan to use for evaluating 
climate performance is carbon intensity, which is a 
measure of GHG emissions per unit of output. Using 
intensity will enable us to evaluate the relative 
efficiency of companies and to adjust for factors 
such as size, clearly showing which are performing 
the best (or getting better). 
We also want to take advantage of the huge 
opportunity to support existing and new green 
companies and to help others lower their 
carbon footprint — all while advancing economic 
development and standards of living for people 
around the world. This includes helping our clients 
invest in significant and continuous performance 
improvements, new technologies, alternative 
energy solutions, and research and development 
(R&D). Through our recently launched Center 
for Carbon Transition, clients will have access to 
information resources, as well as advisory and 
financing solutions that will help them evolve in a 
changing world. 
We’re also working to make our own company

to becoming carbon neutral for the emissions 
generated to power our buildings, branches and 
data centers, as well as those related to employee 
travel. A big focus of our strategy is to generate our 
own power using solar. 
Currently, we have plans to install 40 megawatts of 
solar capacity across our corporate office buildings 
in the United States and the United Kingdom. This 
includes a 14.8-megawatt rooftop and carport solar 
installation at our corporate campus in Columbus, 
Ohio, which will produce about 75% of its power 
needs. We’re also installing 30 megawatts of solar 
capacity at 900 retail branch locations across the 
United States, which will provide approximately 
35% of each branch’s power needs.
We have an opportunity to make the world a 
better place for ourselves, for our children and 
grandchildren, and for all living things that share 
this planet with us.

Great management is critical to the long-term 
success of any large organization. Strong 
management is disciplined and rigorous. 
Facts, analysis, detail … facts, analysis, detail

it does not end. Complex activity requires 
hard work and no uneducated guesswork.

outcome. Develop great models but under-
stand they are not the answer – judgment 
has to be involved in matters related to 
human beings and extraordinary events. 
You need to have good decision-making 
processes. Force urgency and kill compla-
cency. Know that there is competition 
everywhere, all the time. But even if you do 
all of this well, it is not enough.
1. Enforce a good decision-making process.
A good decision-making process involves 
having the right people in the room with all 
information fully shared (all too often I have 
seen precisely the opposite). There is also the 
need for constant feedback and follow-up. A 
bad decision-making process kills. If neces-
sary, review the information over and over 
– often the answer is simply waiting to be 
found – and if you don’t have to, don’t rush. 
While intuition matters, and it can be the 
final deciding factor, intuition is not guessing 
– it is usually based on years of experience, 
hard work and practice. 
2. Examine raw data and focus on real numbers.
It is helpful to try to separate and examine 
actual raw data versus calculated numbers.  
A few examples will suffice: 
You always learn a lot more when you dig 
deep into the numbers. Look at total car 
sales, the number of people employed or 
the actual price of goods compared with 
calculated data like gross domestic product 
(GDP), inflation or productivity. For the 
latter, examine all of the methodologies and 
assumptions that go into those calculations. 
For instance, productivity tries to adjust for 
(or simply sometimes can’t adjust for) new 
products that are superior to old products, 
such as smartphones versus dumb phones; 
similarly, calculations for inflation factor in 
something called “owners’ equivalent rent,” 
which generally differs substantially from 
actual home prices or rental costs. 
Applied to corporate operations, examine 
the details. Many companies look at “net 
new accounts,” which could be going up 
dramatically because of prices or marketing 
– masking attrition or consumers’ dissatis-
faction with the product. In detail, look at 
errors, complaints, attrition, competitors and 
other new entrants.
Look at market share by customer segment 
so as not to miss behavior shifts. Frequently, 
raw data tell a different story from what 
management may be saying: Too often 
management teams use the facts to justify 
what they already think or to celebrate what 
they believe is a great success. 
Being true to these principles requires 
relentless discipline – which you should 
expect of us.

4. Before conducting an important analysis, assess all relevant factors involved.
I frequently see people trying to understand 
a complex situation without considering 
all the factors involved. In the final section, 
I attempt to analyze China as a strategic 
competitor. It’s critical to weigh all the 
factors: cultural, psychological and historical. 
Also, what are the legal factors, and how is 
the rule of law applied? What is the coun-
try’s situation with raw materials? What is 
the country’s geography and relationship 
with its neighbors? It is important to lay out 
all the important variables before you start 
an assessment to ensure that they are all 
carefully reviewed and that one’s judgment 
is not clouded early on by overfocusing on 
just a few issues. 
In business, this type of assessment should 
also be applied to your competitors and to 
those you deem to be future competitors, as 
well as to your own strengths and weak-
nesses. In the next section, I describe the 
evolving competitive landscape for banks. 
While I am fanatical about detail and multi-
year analysis, it’s important to be cautious 
about its application. Assumptions are 
frequently involved, and small changes  
in a few variables can dramatically change 
an outcome. 
Even net present value analysis fails to 
capture the true value of something after a 
certain period of time. For instance, people 
commonly look at the five-year net present 
value of a customer acquisition, which 
can mask the true compounding effect of 
keeping that client for 20 years. And we have 
often seen net present value analysis fail 
to capture ancillary benefits (like customer 
happiness) that can often be more important 
than the analysis itself.
Sometimes a new product or an investment 
should simply be considered table stakes 
– meaning there’s no need to do analysis 
at all. Think about banks adding the capa-
bility of opening new accounts digitally, for 
example, or maintaining a strong technology 
infrastructure and adopting new technolo-
gies, like cloud or artificial intelligence (AI). 
These could be life-or-death decisions for 
a company, so instead of focusing on net 
present value, the emphasis should be on 
getting the work done properly, efficiently 
and quickly. 
Bureaucrats can torture people with analysis, 
stifling innovation, new products, testing  
and intuition. 
In the last section, I go into further detail 
about how certain analyses fail to guide us to 
the right answer in public policy – particularly 
around complex issues like healthcare, job 
creation, mortgage markets and infrastructure. 
3. Understand when analysis is necessary and when it impedes change.
23
II.  LESSONS FROM LEADERSHIP
5. Always deal with reality. 
In business, as in life, we must deal with 
both certainty and uncertainty. A simple look 
at history and our economic past illustrates 
the rather unpredictable nature of things. 
As a result, at the firm we try to look at all 
the possibilities, as well as their probabili-
ties. For example, we conduct well over 100 
stress tests each week to make sure we are 
prepared for what we are not predicting. 
We even evaluate the laws and regulations 
we live under today and project how they 
might be interpreted 10 years from now – we 
call this “reinterpretation risk.” We look at 
a broad range of possibilities and probabil-
ities to ensure that we understand, as best 
as we can, all of the possible outcomes – 
recognizing that we are not trying to make a 
forecast with certainty. Sometimes the action 
you take may not be the one that gives you 
the best outcome but the one that gives you 
a good outcome and reduces the possibilities 
of bad outcomes. 
It also is often very difficult to capture the 
inflection points in the economy. Most people 
imagine the future as being roughly equiva-
lent to the past, give or take a bit. However, we 
know there are significant inflection points, 
which are sometimes easy to see in hindsight 
but almost impossible to predict. 
While we also try to keep things as stream-
lined as possible, making things simpler than 
they really are is equally flawed. Too many 
times people seek simple, cookie-cutter solu-
tions that sound good but just don’t work. 
For example, class size in schools matters 
but not necessarily in all types of classes. In 
Vietnam, when a major city once had a rat 
population problem, the government devised 
what it thought was an easy, foolproof solu-
tion: Pay people to kill rats. All people had to 
do was bring in a rat tail to be paid. What the 
government didn’t consider was that people 
would breed rats for a supply of rat tails to 
sell. (All compensation schemes should be 
continuously re-evaluated.)
24
II.  LESSONS FROM LEADERSHIP
6. Remain open to learning how to become a better leader.
In addition to the above thoughts on anal-
ysis, assessment and good decision making, 
some softer leadership lessons are equally 
important.
As companies get bigger and more complex, 
leaders need to be more like coaches and 
conductors than players. If CEOs are running 
a smaller business, they can literally be 
involved in virtually everything and make 
most of the decisions – they often rely on 
traditional command-and-control tactics. 
This approach does not work as companies 
get bigger – the CEOs simply cannot be 
involved in every major decision. Command 
and constant feedback may be better than 
command and control. Here is where leaders 
would be better off providing clear direction 
and letting people do their job, including 
making mistakes along the way. Soft power – 
essentially trust and maturity – may become 
more important than hard power. Soft power 
creates respect among team members, with 
the coach offering honest assessment and 
support while allowing flexibility. Here the 
boss makes fewer but tougher decisions, such 
as removing people – when it must be done 
– and even then, it is handled respectfully. 
People will give to the best of their ability for 
leaders they respect and who they know are 
trying to help them succeed. 
Respect and learn from your people. Managers 
and leaders get spread pretty thin. While they 
should have a wide grasp of many subjects, 
they could not possibly know everything their 
people know. Leaders should continually be 
learning from their people. They should go to 
a sales conference and ask lots of questions of 
their salespeople. Gather technology people 
in the room with branch managers and ask, 
“How are things working?” Taking a road trip 
should not be only for the purpose of showing 
the flag but also for learning from your 
employees and customers. 
Have curiosity. It’s important to ask questions 
to try to understand varying points of view. 
Be willing to change your mind. Read every-
thing. Don’t defend decisions of the past. 
Leaders should be happy when their people 
prove them wrong. Do not have a rigid 
mindset. And do not be complacent. 
Skip hierarchy. If everything in a large orga-
nization must go up and down the hierar-
chical ladder, bureaucratic arteriosclerosis 
along with CYA sets in, and that company’s 
life expectancy is substantially shortened. 
It should be routine that data, memos and 
ideas are shared – skipping hierarchies – and 
aren’t vetted by all in the chain of command. 
This makes people more responsible for 
what they are doing, improves the dissem-
ination of new information and new ideas, 
and speeds things up overall. In addition, 
it’s good to have a few mavericks who are 
not afraid to shake things up. The ones who 
challenge authority or convention often get 
far more done than the ones who go along to 
get along. Collaboration is wonderful, but it 
can be overdone. 
Act at the speed of relevance. When leaders 
have plenty of time to make decisions, they 
should analyze all factors over and over – 
take the necessary time, as choices can be 
hard to reverse. And there are other deci-
sions that are more like “battlefield promo-
tions” where there’s no luxury of time, and, 
in fact, going slow may make things much 
worse. I’ve also seen people take a tremen-
dous amount of time to make an unim-
portant decision, which just wastes time and 
slows things down. 
In business, some decisions should be made 
carefully – for instance, putting the right 
people in the right job. But others, such 
as making pricing decisions, dealing with 
customer problems and handling reputa-
tional issues, must be done quickly, for these 
problems do not age well. 
25
The Importance of Developing Leaders 
Earlier in this section, I mentioned that my number 
one priority is to put a healthy and productive 
succession process in place. As I will be increasingly 
focused on this process, I would like to share my 
thoughts about the essential qualities a leader 
must have, particularly as they relate to a large 
multinational corporation like JPMorgan Chase.
Leadership is an honor, a privilege and a deep 
obligation. When leaders make mistakes, a lot of 
people can get hurt. Being true to oneself and 
avoiding self-deception are as important to a 
leader as having people to turn to for thoughtful, 
unbiased advice. I believe social intelligence 
and “emotional quotient,” or EQ, matter in 
management. EQ can include empathy, clarity of 
thought, compassion and strength of character. 
Good people want to work for good leaders. Bad 
leaders can drive out almost anyone who’s good 
because they are corrosive to an organization; and 
since many are manipulative and deceptive, it often 
is a challenge to find them and root them out. 
At many of the best companies throughout history, 
the constant creation of good leaders is what has 
enabled the organizations to stand the true test of 
greatness — the test of time.
Below are some essential hallmarks of a good 
leader. While we cannot be great at all of these 
traits — I know I’m not — to be successful, a leader 
needs to get most of them right.
Discipline
This means holding regular business reviews, talent 
reviews and team meetings and constantly striving 
for improvement — from having a strong work ethic 
to making lists and doing real, detailed follow-up. 
Leadership is like exercise; the effect has to be 
sustained for it to do any good.
Fortitude
This attribute often is missing in leaders: They need 
to have a fierce resolve to act. It means driving 
change, fighting bureaucracy and politics, and 
taking ownership and responsibility.
High Standards
Leaders must set high standards of performance all 
the time, at a detailed level and with a real sense 
of urgency. Leaders must compare themselves with 
the best. Huge institutions have a tendency toward 
slowing things down, which demands that leaders 
push forward constantly. True leaders must set the 
highest standards of integrity — those standards 
are not embedded in the business but require 
conscious choices. Such standards demand that we 
treat customers and employees the way we would 
want to be treated ourselves or the way we would 
want our own mother to be treated.
Ability to Face Facts
In a cold-blooded, honest way, leaders emphasize 
the negatives at management meetings and focus 
on what can be improved (of course, it’s okay to 
celebrate the successes, too). All reporting must be 
accurate, and all relevant facts must be reported, 
with full disclosure and on one set of books.
Openness
Sharing information all the time is vital — we should 
debate the issues and alternative approaches, not 
the facts. The best leaders kill bureaucracy — it 
can cripple an organization — and watch for signs 
of politics, like sidebar meetings after the real 
meeting because people wouldn’t speak their mind 
at the right time. Equally important, leaders get 
out in the field regularly so as not to lose touch. 
Anyone in a meeting should feel free to speak his 
or her mind without fear of offending anyone else. 
I once heard someone describe the importance of 
having “at least one truth-teller at the table.” Well, 
if there is just one truth-teller at the table, you’re in 
trouble — everyone should be a truth-teller.
Reprinted from my 2009 Letter to Shareholders
26
Setup for Success
An effective leader makes sure all the right 
people are in the room — from Legal, Systems and 
Operations to Human Resources, Finance and Risk. 
It’s also necessary to set up the right structure. 
When tri-heads report to co-heads, all decisions 
become political — a setup for failure, not success.
Morale-Building
High morale is developed through fixing problems, 
dealing directly and honestly with issues, earning 
respect and winning. It does not come from 
overpaying people or delivering sweet talk, which 
permits the avoidance of hard decision making and 
fosters passive-aggressive behaviors. 
Loyalty, Meritocracy and Teamwork
While I deeply believe in loyalty, it often is 
misused. Loyalty should be to the principles for 
which someone stands and to the institution: 
Loyalty to an individual frequently is another 
form of cronyism. Leaders demand a lot from 
their employees and should be loyal to them 
— but loyalty and mutual respect are two-way 
streets. Loyalty to employees does not mean that 
a manager owes them a particular job. Loyalty 
to employees means building a healthy, vibrant 
company; telling them the truth; and giving them 
meaningful work, training and opportunities. If 
employees fall down, we should get them the help 
they need. Meritocracy and teamwork also are 
critical but frequently misunderstood. Meritocracy 
means putting the best person in the job, which 
promotes a sense of justice in the organization 
rather than the appearance of cynicism: “Here 
they go again, taking care of their friends.” 
Finally, while teamwork is important and often 
code for “getting along,” equally important is an 
individual’s ability to have the courage to stand 
alone and do the right thing.
Fair Treatment
The best leaders treat all people properly and 
respectfully, from clerks to CEOs. Everyone needs 
to help everyone else at the company because 
everyone’s collective purpose is to serve clients. 
When strong leaders consider promoting people, 
they pick those who are respected and ask 
themselves, Would I want to work for him? Would I 
want my kid to report to her?
Humility
Leaders need to acknowledge those who came 
before them and helped shape the enterprise — 
it’s not all their own doing. There’s a lot of luck 
involved in anyone’s success, and a little humility is 
important. The overall goal must be to help build 
a great company — then we can do more for our 
employees, our customers and our communities.
27
To fairly assess the competitive landscape 
for banks, you must fairly evaluate their 
strengths and weaknesses to deal with both 
the current competition and evolving compe-
tition. Banks have significant strengths 
– brand, economies of scale, profitability, 
and deep roots with their customers and 
within their communities. Many companies, 
including banks, have flaws of their own 
making – usually due to bureaucracy, compla-
cency and lack of a deep competitive spirit. 
Banks have other weaknesses, born somewhat 
out of their success – for example, inflexible 
“legacy systems” that need to be moved to the 
cloud if they are to remain competitive. Banks 
are also required to deal with extensive regu-
lations, which can hinder new competition 
and/or create an opening for both existing and 
evolving competitors. Banks fiercely compete 
with each other and now face fierce competi-
tion from multiple vectors. 
Banks already compete against a large and 
powerful shadow banking system. And 
they are facing extensive competition from 
Silicon Valley, both in the form of fintechs 
and Big Tech companies (Amazon, Apple, 
Facebook, Google and now Walmart), that is 
here to stay. As the importance of cloud, AI 
and digital platforms grows, this competi-
tion will become even more formidable. As 
a result, banks are playing an increasingly 
smaller role in the financial system. 
I am completely in favor of open compe-
tition, and much of the competition that 
I cover in this section will be good for 
America. One of the necessities for a healthy 
economy, and one at the core of America’s 
success, is a strong, vibrant financial system. 
The disciplined allocation of capital, and the 
constant search for new opportunities for 
capital, is critical to growth (a corollary of the 
free and intelligent movement of capital is 
the free movement of human talent, which, 
ultimately, may be even more important). 
America’s financial system is the best the 
world has ever seen, from our regulatory 
system and rule of law to exchanges, venture 
capital and private capital, banks and shadow 
banks. As our system changes, our govern-
ment and regulators need to understand 
that maintaining the vibrancy, safety and 
soundness of this system is critical – and 
this includes maintaining a relatively fair 
and balanced playing field. While I am still 
confident that JPMorgan Chase can grow and 
earn a good return for its shareholders, the 
competition will be intense, and we must get 
faster and be more creative.

THREATS — FROM VIRTUALLY EVERY ANGLE

III.  BANKS’ ENORMOUS COMPETITIVE THREATS — FROM VIRTUALLY EVERY ANGLE
1. Banks are playing an increasingly smaller role in the financial system.
In the chart below, you will see that U.S. banks (and European banks) have become much 
smaller in size relative to multiple measures, ranging from shadow banks to fintech competi-
tors and to markets in general. 
Whether you look at the chart above over 10 
or 20 years, U.S. banks have become much 
smaller relative to U.S. financial markets and 
to the size of most of the shadow banks. You 
can also see the rapid growth of payment 
and fintech companies and the extraordinary 
size of Big Tech companies. (As an aside, 
capital and global systemically important 
financial institution (G-SIFI) capital rules 
were supposed to reflect the economy’s 
increased size and banks’ reduced size within 
the economy. This simply has not happened 
in the United States.) 
Some regulators will look at the chart above 
and point out that risk has been moved out 
of the banking system, which they wanted 
and which clearly makes banks safer. That 
may be true, but there is a flip side – banks 
are reliable, less-costly and consistent 
credit providers throughout good times 
and in bad times, whereas many of the 
credit providers listed in the chart above 
are not. More important, transactions made 
by well-controlled, well-supervised and 
well-capitalized banks may be less risky to 
the system than those transactions that are 
pushed into the shadows.

III.  BANKS’ ENORMOUS COMPETITIVE THREATS — FROM VIRTUALLY EVERY ANGLE
2. The growth in shadow and fintech banking calls for level playing field regulation.
The chart below shows the potential regula-
tory differences between being a bank and 
being a nonbank or a fintech company – 
though this varies for each type of company 
on each item depending upon its legal and 
regulatory status. In some cases, these regula-
tory differences may be completely appro-
priate, but certainly not in all cases. 
When I make a list like this, I know I will be 
accused of complaining about bank regula-
tions. But I am simply laying out the facts 
for our shareholders in trying to assess the 
competitive landscape going forward. 
It is completely clear that, increasingly, 
many banking products, such as payments 
and certain forms of deposits among others, 
are moving out of the banking system. In 
addition, lending in many forms – including 
mortgage, student, leveraged, consumer and 
non-credit card consumer – is moving out of 
the banking system. Neobanks and nonbanks 
are gaining share in consumer accounts, 
which effectively hold cash-like deposits. 
Payments are also moving out of the banking 
system in merchant processing and in debit 
or alternative payment systems. 
We believe that many of these new compet-
itors have done a terrific job in easing 
customers’ pain points and making digital 
platforms extremely simple to use. But growth 
in shadow banking has also partially been 
made possible because rules and regulations 
imposed upon banks are not necessarily 
imposed upon these nonbanks. While some of 
this may have been deliberate, sometimes the 
rules were accidentally calibrated to move risk 
in an unintended way. We should remember 
that the quantum of risk may not have 
changed – it just got moved to a less-regu-
lated environment. And new risks get created. 
While it is not clear that the rise in nonbanks 
and shadow banking has reached the point 
of systemic risk, this trend is accelerating and 
needs to be assiduously monitored, which we 
do regularly as part of our own business.

III.  BANKS’ ENORMOUS COMPETITIVE THREATS — FROM VIRTUALLY EVERY ANGLE
A few items need further explanation. On 
capital requirements, you should always 
remember that the market determines this 
level, not regulators, and to the extent that 
capital requirements in one entity are much 
higher than another, activities will move. 
Ironically, because standardized capital and 
G-SIFI capital do not recognize credit risk, 
banks have a peculiar incentive to hold 
higher risk credit rather than lower risk 
credit. All companies have operational risk, 
and most companies absorb operating losses 
through earnings. Banks are required to hold 
substantial capital against this risk. (I’m 
not debating that there is operational risk.) 
And because of the Durbin Amendment, if a 
bank has a customer with a small checking 
account who spends $20,000 a year on a 
debit card, the bank will only receive $120 
in debit revenue – while a small bank or 
nonbank would receive $240. This differ-
ence may determine whether you can even 
compete in certain customer segments. It’s 
important to note that while some of the 
fintechs have done an excellent job, they may 
actually be more expensive to the customer. 
Finally, it’s important to point out that not 
only has private credit been moving to the 
private markets but so have companies them-
selves. The number of public companies in 
the United States has been dropping dramat-
ically over the past two decades, which has 
corresponded to an even larger increase in 
the number of private companies. Following 
its peak at 8,000 in 1997, the number of 
public companies is now around 6,000, and 
if you exclude non-operating companies, 
such as investment funds and trust compa-
nies, the decline is even more dramatic. 
This is worthy of serious study. The reasons 
are complex and may include factors such 
as onerous reporting requirements; higher 
litigation expenses; annual shareholder 
meetings focused on matters that most share-
holders view as frivolous or inappropriate 
for company actions; costly regulations; less 
compensation flexibility; and heightened 
public scrutiny. It’s incumbent upon us to 
figure out why so many companies and so 
much capital are being moved out of the 
transparent public markets to the less trans-
parent private markets and whether this is in 
the country’s long-term interest. 
We need competition – because it makes 
banking better – and we need to manage 
the emerging risks with level playing field 
regulation in a way that ensures safety and 
soundness across the industry.
3. AI, the cloud and digital are transforming how we do business.
We cannot overemphasize the extraordinary 
importance of new technology in the new 
world. Today, all technology is built “cloud- 
enabled,” which means the applications and 
their associated data can run on the cloud. 
This brings many extraordinary advantages, 
but the one that I’d like to spotlight is the 
immediate ability to access data and associ-
ated machine learning with virtually unlim-
ited compute power. Essentially, in the cloud, 
you can “access” hundreds of databases and 
deploy machine learning in a split second – 
something mainframes and legacy systems 
and databases simply cannot do. To go from 
the legacy world to the cloud, applications 
not only have to be “refactored,” but, more 
important, data also must be “re-platformed” 
so it is accessible. This availability of data 
– and banks have a tremendous amount of 
data – makes data enormously valuable and 
digitally accessible. All of this work takes 
time and money, but it’s absolutely essential 
that we do it. 
We already extensively use AI, quite success-
fully, in fraud and risk, marketing, pros-
pecting, idea generation, operations, trading 
and in other areas – to great effect, but we are 
still at the beginning of this journey. And we 
are training our people in machine learning – 
there simply is no speed fast enough.

III.  BANKS’ ENORMOUS COMPETITIVE THREATS — FROM VIRTUALLY EVERY ANGLE
4. Fintech and Big Tech are here … big time!
Fintech companies here and around the 
world are making great strides in building 
both digital and physical banking products 
and services. From loans to payment systems 
to investing, they have done a great job in 
developing easy-to-use, intuitive, fast and 
smart products. We have spoken about this 
for years, but this competition now is every-
where. Fintech’s ability to merge social media, 
use data smartly and integrate with other 
platforms rapidly (often without the disadvan-
tages of being an actual bank) will help these 
companies win significant market share. 
Importantly, Big Tech (Amazon, Apple, Face-
book, Google – and, as I said, now I’d include 
Walmart) is here, too. Their strengths are 
extraordinary, with ubiquitous platforms 
and endless data. At a minimum, they will 
all embed payments systems within their 
ecosystems and create a marketplace of bank 
products and services. Some may create 
exclusive white label banking relationships, 
and it is possible some will use various 
banking licenses to do it directly. 
Though their strengths may be substantial, Big 
Tech companies do have some issues to deal 
with that may, in fact, slow them down. Their 
regulatory environment, globally, is heating up, 
and they will have to confront major issues in 
the future (banks have faced similar scrutiny). 
Issues include data privacy and use, how taxes 
are paid on digital products, and antitrust and 
anticompetitive issues – such as favoring their 
own products and services over others on 
their platform and how they price products 
and access to their platforms. In addition, Big 
Tech will have very strong competition – not 
just from JPMorgan Chase in banking but also 
from each other. And that competition is far 
bigger than just banking – Big Tech companies 
now compete with each other in advertising, 
commerce, search and social. 
5. JPMorgan Chase is aggressively adapting to new challenges.
As tough as the competition will be, 
JPMorgan Chase is well-positioned for the 
challenge. But our eyes are wide open as 
the landscape changes rapidly and dramat-
ically. We have an extraordinary number of 
products and services, a large, existing client 
base, huge economies of scale, a fortress 
balance sheet and a great, trusted brand. We 
also have an extraordinary amount of data, 
and we need to adopt AI and cloud as fast 
as possible so we can make better use of it 
to better serve our customers. We need to 
make our extraordinary number of products 
and services a huge plus by improving ease 
of use and reducing complexity. We need 
to move faster and bolder in how we attack 
new markets while protecting our existing 
ones. Sometimes new markets look too small 
or appear not to be critical to our customer 
base – until they are. We intend to be a little 
more aggressive here. 
While we will argue for a level playing field, 
both in terms of how products and services 
are treated by regulators and possibly how 
competition should be treated across plat-
forms, we are not relying on much to change. 
So we will simply have to contend with the 
hand we are dealt and adjust our strategies 
as appropriate. 
We have mentioned that our highest and 
best use of capital is to expand our busi-
nesses, and we would prefer to make great 
acquisitions instead of buying back stock. 
We are somewhat constrained by how much 
we can grow our balance sheet because our 
capital charges will grow with our size, so 
sometimes buying back stock may still be 
the best option. But acquisitions are in our 
future, and fintech is an area where some of 
that cash could be put to work – this could 
include payments, asset management, data, 
and relevant products and services. 
We will continue to do everything in our 
power to make JPMorgan Chase successful – 
and are confident we can do so. 
32
We cannot overemphasize the importance 
of cyber risk, not just to our bank (we 
spend more than $600 million a year on 
cybersecurity) but also to our customers, 
countries, economies and critical industries 
(i.e., telecom and power). We have pointed 
out to our shareholders before that having 
disciplined cyber hygiene is almost as 
important as the money you spend. Threats 
to our cybersecurity need urgent attention 
from our government as issues of national 
security and impediments to trade. Govern-
ments should build on prior agreements in 
the United Nations, recognizing the appli-
cability of international law to cyberspace 
and enforcing obligations to hold bad actors 
accountable. Acknowledging that govern-
ments and their regulatory agencies are 
prime targets for cyber criminals, these 
agencies need to provide transparency to 
those affected by incidents (e.g., financial 
institutions and others that hold sensitive 
data), invest in the uplift to cybersecurity, 
and adopt safe and sound practices for data 
protection and handling.
Much of our extraordinary cyber capabil-
ities are also used to train and protect our 
customers, particularly in the areas of risk 
and fraud.
In this section, I review and analyze some of the current critical issues that affect our company. 
1. Cyber risk remains a significant threat.
IV. SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY
2. Brexit was finally accomplished — but uncertainties linger.
Brexit was accomplished, but many issues 
still need to be negotiated. And in those 
negotiations, Europe has had, and will 
continue to have, the upper hand. In the 
short run (i.e., the next few years), this 
cannot possibly be a positive for the United 
Kingdom’s GDP – the effect after that will be 
completely based upon whether the United 
Kingdom has a comprehensive and well- 
executed strategic plan that is acceptable 
to Europe. Included among the unresolved 
questions is how financial services will 
operate. London has been a major financial 
center that, under all laws and regulations, 
could conduct business throughout Europe. 
For most of us, the bulk of our operations 
(i.e., risk, compliance, audit, legal, regula-
tory, market-making, investment banking, 
research and asset management) were 
performed centrally in London. It was hugely 
efficient for all of Europe – and for finan-
cial services companies as well. London is 
a magnificent place to do business in terms 
of the rule of law, human capital, tech-
nology, transportation, language and many 
other facets. But future financial regulations 
were left uncertain in Brexit; and it is clear 
that, over time, European politicians and 
regulators will make many understandable 
demands to move functions into European 
jurisdictions. Because of this – and because 
of strong European efforts to compete with 
London – Paris, Frankfurt, Dublin and 
Amsterdam will grow in importance as more 
financial functions are performed there. 
Even so, few winners are likely to emerge 
from this fragmentation.
During this transition, our costs (most 
of which will probably be passed on to 
customers in one form or another) will go 
up as functions become duplicated. We may 
reach a tipping point many years out when 
it may make sense to move all functions that 
service Europe out of the United Kingdom 
and into continental Europe. But London still 
has the opportunity to adapt and reinvent 
itself, particularly as the digital landscape 
continues to revolutionize financial services. 
Innovation is key to preparing for doing the 
business of tomorrow versus relying on the 
shifting ways of the past.

IV.  SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY
3. New accounting requirements affect reserve reporting but not how we run our business. 
A new loan loss reserving method called 
the current expected credit losses (CECL) 
standard was adopted by large financial 
institutions, effective January 1, 2020. To 
oversimplify, there were two main changes. 
First, you must reserve for expected credit 
losses over the full remaining expected life of 
the loan, whereas in the past, we reserved for 
losses that had already been incurred using 
a forecast over a loss emergence period, for 
example the ensuing 12 months or so for 
credit cards. Second, you were to incorporate 
different reasonable and supportable macro-
economic forecasts (for multiple scenarios) 
in estimating losses. Given the benign macro-
economic environment when this new CECL 
standard was adopted, it increased reserves 
by only $4.3 billion, which was primarily 
attributed to moving to lifetime loss coverage 
for Card, with only a small amount of 
reserves for the probability of a far worse 
economic environment. 
Hundreds of variables go into the scenarios 
and calculations shown in the chart below. 
During periods of stress, the firm leaned 
more heavily to the downside to reflect 
uncertainties not fully captured by the 
scenarios themselves. Uncertainties included 
a substantial drop in headline employment 
without corresponding job creation, the 
degree of permanent job losses, the extent 
and timing of federal government assis-
tance, unknowns around vaccine efficacy 
against new virus strains, and the poten-
tial for economic scarring from changes 
in consumer behavior and the recovery of 
directly impacted sectors.

IV.  SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY
The best way to look at this is to analyze our 
loan loss reserves as of December 31, 2020. 
Our central case is essentially our baseline 
forecast (and is roughly similar to the Federal 
Reserve’s current forecast at the time), 
which would have unemployment over the 
ensuing 12 months at 6.5%. If we reserved 
to this case, our reserves would total $22 
billion. But we run multiple scenarios – one 
of which is an extreme adverse case. This 
worst case, which is slightly more severe 
than the Federal Reserve’s extreme adverse 
case, would have unemployment over the 
ensuing 12 months at 12.5% (among other 
variables). If we reserved as if this scenario 
had a 100% chance of happening, we would 
require $45 billion in reserves. After proba-
bility weighting multiple scenarios, we ended 
the year with $31 billion in reserves. 
Clearly in turbulent times, these scenarios 
and the probabilities assigned to them are 
highly uncertain and volatile. The following 
are also clear and extremely important:  
The firm earns almost $50 billion +/- pre- 
provision profit annually; it is able to easily 
handle large increases in reserves; and we 
could easily have done substantially more 
while maintaining high capital and high 
liquidity. This is also why we saw no reason 
to cut our dividend. If, however, the worst-
case scenario had happened (which means 
it could have gotten even worse from there), 
we might have cut our dividend to retain 
capital out of prudence.
Importantly, CECL does not change risk 
management or the way we run the 
company. We have been lending, and will 
continue to lend, to our clients and customers 
throughout the pandemic with prudent risk 
management. Our credit risk decisions and 
broader risk appetite are mostly driven by 
our clients’ needs and market conditions 
rather than solely by reserve methodology. 
While reserve levels are an estimate reflecting 
management’s expectations of credit losses at 
the balance sheet date, they may not reflect 
the amount of losses ultimately realized.
4. While we disbanded Haven, we will continue to build on what we learned.
Although the United States has some of the 
best healthcare in the world (i.e., doctors, 
pharmaceutical care and innovation) and 
many people from other countries come here 
when they need serious medical attention, 
the problems associated with healthcare are 
serious, rampant and obvious. Our costs are 
more than twice those of the developed world 
without justification by better outcomes. 
There is no transparency in pricing, with 
patients legitimately complaining of hidden 
costs. And chronic care is not necessarily 
managed properly. More than 30 million 
Americans are uninsured, and we are falling 
short in basic wellness. 
Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and 
JPMorgan Chase set up Haven to address 
some of these problems, and, in the process, 
we learned a lot about how the healthcare 
system could be improved. Although we 
decided to disband Haven, JPMorgan Chase 
will continue to build on what we learned. 
We will invest in healthcare innovation and 
other approaches to improve the health and 
well-being of our employees and address 
this critical national issue. More details will 
be shared as we progress.

Within days of realizing that COVID-19 was a global pandemic that would virtually close 
down large parts of the world’s economies, the U.S. government moved with unprece-
dented speed. Fortunately, banks were part of the solution – unlike in the Great Recession. 
And unlike the Great Recession, the U.S. economy was actually in good shape going into 
the COVID-19 recession. Though there are many differences, it’s instructive to compare the 
recovery from the Great Recession with the expected recovery from the COVID-19 recession.
1. Bold action by the Fed and the U.S. government effectively reversed financial panic. 
The Federal Reserve (critically, with the 
support of the U.S. Treasury) immediately 
rolled out facilities that financed Treasuries, 
corporate bonds, mortgage-backed secu-
rities and other securities that effectively 
reversed the financial panic taking place. A 
full-blown financial crisis would have made 
the COVID-19 recession far worse, deeper 
and longer. Markets reacted extremely posi-
tively, and companies, over the next nine 
months, raised an unprecedented $2 trillion 
in debt and equity at good prices, dramati-
cally improving their financial condition and 
balance sheets.
Congress, importantly, also took immediate 
action to provide fiscal stimulus, the Corona-
virus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, 
also known as the CARES Act, totaling $2.2 
trillion. This largely consisted of stimulus 
payments to individuals, enhanced unem-
ployment insurance and loans, which could 
be forgiven, to small businesses. Please see 
the sidebar on page 36 for more detail on the 
Paycheck Protection Program. 
Suffice it to say while real damage was 
done, the size and scope of these programs 
dramatically reversed the deterioration of 
the economy and unemployment, which hit 
14.8% in April 2020 but made steady prog-
ress back to 6.7% by the end of the year 
– though this number underrepresents the 
damage that was done because of the large 
deterioration in labor force participation 
and the potential permanent loss of many 
small businesses. 
One last important point: The speed and 
breadth of the programs were critical, and 
there is no way they could have been done 
perfectly. While it always makes sense to do 
a thorough postmortem review and to prop-
erly punish those who deliberately misuse 
emergency government programs, we should 
try to avoid excessive finger-pointing.
V. COVID-19 AND THE ECONOMY
2. Banks entered this recent crisis in great shape and were part of the solution coming out.
The banking system was in excellent shape 
going into this crisis, and just about every 
bank took extensive actions to help their 
customers, employees and communities.  
The sidebar on page 37 details how JPMorgan 
Chase responded to support various stake-
holders. It’s important to note that many of 
these programs went far beyond what was 
requested by the government. 
Of course, banks are always affected, for the 
better and worse, by just about everything 
that impacts the economy. Some have said 
that banks were helped, or even bailed out, 
by the government’s actions. The govern-
ment took these actions to help those who 
needed it – not to help the banks. These 
actions helped just about everyone – and 
they had a collateral benefit to the banks.

The Paycheck Protection Program, while not 
perfect, was a tremendous achievement. 
In the spring of 2020, lenders had seven frantic 
days to get ready to accept applications for $349 
billion in loans through the newly created Paycheck 
Protection Program. Often known simply as PPP, 
the federal program provided desperately needed 
cash to help businesses sustain payroll so their 
employees could put food on their tables and make 
their rent or mortgage payments. If a business 
used the loan to pay its employees and certain 
other permitted expenses, the Small Business 
Administration would fully forgive the loan. 
Not surprisingly, there were bumps in the road 
as the SBA and lenders worked around the clock 
to establish and implement specific rules and 
processes, as well as develop the technology to 
support the program. Ultimately, though, it was a 
lifesaver for millions of U.S. businesses. In Business 
Banking, we processed more than four years’ worth 
of loan applications in 23 days — a combination of 
digital prowess and the efforts of more than 1,000 
people who manually reviewed applications and 
contacted clients after hours and on weekends to 
correct errors.
All told, in 2020, we funded over 280,000 PPP 
loans for more than $32 billion — the most of any 
lender — to companies that employ a total of 3+ 
million people. We are especially proud that we 
helped some of America’s smallest businesses: 
childcare centers, social service agencies, schools, 
grocery stores, physicians’ offices and restaurants. 
In fact, half of our loans went to companies with 
fewer than five employees. And we’re fully engaged 
in the 2021 edition of PPP: Through March 2021, 
we’ve funded in excess of 130,000 loans for 
more than $10 billion — again, the most of any 
lender. And more than 90% of those loans went to 
businesses with fewer than 25 employees.
Given that most small businesses keep just two 
weeks of cash on hand, the government and 
lenders had to act with exceptional speed. What 
they created in record time was unprecedented 
and really quite extraordinary. The program 
accomplished what it set out to do. Together, we 
helped many small businesses survive and kept a 
painful recession from becoming far, far worse.

JPMorgan Chase: Supporting the “Real Economy” during the COVID-19 Crisis
To support the “real economy” — our customers, clients, employees and communities impacted by the global crisis — JPMorgan Chase 
has brought the full force of its core business and expertise.
In 2020, we raised capital and provided credit totaling $2.3 trillion for customers and businesses of all sizes, helping them meet 
payroll, avoid layoffs and support operations. 
Through March 2021, we’ve provided more than $40 billion to more than 400,000 small businesses through the PPP program. 
Since March 13, 2020, we’ve delayed payments and refunded fees for customers on over 2 million accounts. 
We committed $250 million in global business and philanthropic initiatives, with particular focus on the most vulnerable people and 
communities hardest hit by the pandemic. 
Our ability to do all this, and more, is the result of the actions and investments we’ve made over many years to build a strong and 
resilient company.

3. The confusing interplay of monetary, fiscal and regulatory policy continues through 
recessions.
Prior to the Great Recession in 2008, banks 
operated under a completely different regu-
latory, capital and liquidity regime. Banks 
held less capital (for many banks, it was too 
little), they left virtually no money deposited 
at the Fed, they generally lent out an amount 
roughly equal to their deposits and they had 
less liquidity, mostly in the form of Trea-
suries and mortgages (the securities portfolio 
was also used for interest rate exposure). 
This completely changed with Dodd-Frank 
(the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and 
Consumer Protection Act) capital/liquidity 
rules in 2010, and it changed again dramati-
cally with the COVID-19 recession of 2020. 
The quantitative easing and fiscal stimulus taken 
after the Great Recession were partially offset by 
changes in regulatory policy. 
As the chart on the next page illustrates, 
until the Great Recession of 2008, banks 
were generally able to lend out 100% of 
their deposits. In addition, they maintained 
liquidity in the form of securities. Dodd-
Frank created a new rule called the liquidity 
coverage ratio (LCR), which required banks 
to permanently “lock up” a lot more liquidity 
and also created more restrictions around 
what counted as liquidity. The new regula-
tions generally limited liquidity sources to 
cash deposits at central banks, Treasuries and 
a portion of government-guaranteed securi-
ties. It should be noted that while the historic 
bank reserve requirement is now zero, it has 
effectively been replaced with LCR, which 
is substantially the same thing as a reserve 
requirement but far more stringent. In addi-
tion, we obviously saw an increase in capital 
requirements and their complexity. Taken 
together, these changes resulted in the loan-
to-deposit ratio dropping to approximately 
75% – and it is likely to stay approximately 
there unless regulations are changed. While 
loans are, of course, subject to supply and 
demand, this is a structural reduction that 
was clearly due to regulatory changes. The 
effect was also enduring: As banks phased in 
these rules, this new restriction limited their 
ability to extend credit, and that, in turn, may 
have held back the economy from reaching 
its maximum potential output.
To understand this in more specific terms, 
look at the chart on the next page that shows, 
prior to the COVID-19 recession, banks had 
$13 trillion in deposits and only $10 trillion 
in loans. This $3 trillion in “lost” lending 
(this is, in part, directly related to the new 
liquidity requirements) may very well have 
contributed to the secular stagnation experi-
enced in the last decade. If $3 trillion more 
had been lent, the banking sector would have 
fostered a more dynamic economy, and GDP 
growth over the past decade would almost 
certainly have been faster. 
But many companies, large and small, may 
not have survived had JPMorgan Chase not 
taken extraordinary efforts to help them.
While the government’s actions were a 
benefit to banks, there is no question the 
banks were able to weather a terrible storm 
while reserving extensively for potential 
future loan losses. Importantly, the Fed 
conducted two additional severely adverse 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review 
(CCAR) stress tests, which projected bank 
results under extreme unemployment, 
GDP loss, market disruption and a smaller 
government stimulus. The result showed 
that banks could withstand this extreme 
outcome while continuing to finance the 
economy. I also have very little doubt that 
if the severely adverse scenario played out, 
JPMorgan Chase would perform far better 
than the stress test projections.
39
39
V.  COVID-19 AND THE ECONOMY
If you aren’t convinced yet – consider how 
surprising it is that $3.4 trillion of quan-
titative easing (QE) and deficit spending 
averaging 5% of GDP over the 10-year period 
after the Great Recession did not result in 
higher GDP growth and possibly higher infla-
tion. As a reference point, in the mid-1970s, 
there was no QE – and deficit spending hit 
4%, which many people thought was the 
main reason for the overheated economy and 
inflation, which, at its peak, was over 12%. 
And so why did all this quantitative easing 
not have the effect you would have thought? 
QE was never effectively tried prior to the 
Great Recession, and it is different from 
fiscal spending. QE is the purchase of securi-
ties from security holders who tend to rein-
vest in the same or similar securities. Clearly, 
QE reduces interest rates, pushes up asset 
prices and creates some spending (through 
the wealth effect). QE, on the one hand, may 
have some inflationary effects, mostly on 
asset prices. But on the other hand, it also 
may have some disinflationary effects – 
lower interest rates themselves, which is an 
input cost for businesses, and lower income 
to savers – which may reduce consumption 
and may increase the propensity to save (e.g., 
we may need to set aside more money to 
protect retirement income). And finally, in 
this most recent round of QE, much of the 
money simply made a round trip – because 
of the new liquidity rules, it ended up back 
as deposits at the Fed, not as loans. 
The fiscal deficit is, pure and simple, giving 
various individuals and institutions money 
to spend – which they will spend over time. 
All things being equal, this is, and always 
has been, inflationary. Of course, in a reces-
sionary environment with low inflation, 
like after the Great Recession, this might be 
precisely what is needed without causing 
overheating or excessive inflation. 
My own view: The anemic growth in the 
decade after the Great Recession was due to 
some of the factors I mention above but also 
due to many of the public policy failures that 
I outline in the next section.

V.  COVID-19 AND THE ECONOMY
40
The QE and deficit-spending response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic is of a completely different 
magnitude and without some of the offsetting 
drags that trailed the Great Recession.
The chart below shows that for the United 
States, QE actual in 2020 and QE projected 
for 2021 total $4.6 trillion or almost 25% 
of GDP. Deficit spending for the two years 
combined is projected to total $6.8 trillion, 
or about 35% of GDP. These numbers are far 
larger than the first couple of years of the 
Great Recession, and it is important to note 
that the rest of the world is showing similar 
actions, compounding the global effect.
As another reference point, during World 
War II the deficit hit almost 30%, and it 
averaged 16% over the five-year period from 
1941 to 1946. This period did not create 
lasting inflation as the circumstances were 
completely different – we were coming out 
of a deep depression, and the money was 
spent financing a war.
Circumstances and starting points matter. 
Before the Great Recession, you had an over-
leveraged financial system and overleveraged 
consumers. For years after the Great Reces-
sion, there was a massive deleveraging in the 
United States by consumers, many investors 
and financial institutions, somewhat due to 
regulations. Today, this is not the case. 
In the United States, the average consumer 
balance sheet is in excellent shape. The 
consumer’s leverage is lower than it has 
been in 40 years. In fact, prior to the last $1.9 
trillion stimulus package, we estimate that 
consumers had excess savings of approxi-
mately $2 trillion. Corporations also have 
an extraordinary amount of cash on their 
balance sheet, estimated to be approxi-
mately $3 trillion. And the financial system 
and investors have already adopted more 
conservative leverage requirements due to 
regulations – so they have very little need 
to deleverage. The QE in this go-around 
will have created more than $3 trillion in 
deposits at U.S. banks, and, unlike the QE 
after the Great Recession, a portion of this 
can be lent out. 
I have little doubt that with excess savings, 
new stimulus savings, huge deficit spending, 
more QE, a new potential infrastructure bill, 
a successful vaccine and euphoria around the 
end of the pandemic, the U.S. economy will 
likely boom. This boom could easily run into 
2023 because all the spending could extend 
well into 2023. The permanent effect of this 
boom will be fully known only when we see 
the quality, effectiveness and sustainability 
of the infrastructure and other government 
investments. I hope there is extraordinary

discipline on how all of this money is spent. 
Spent wisely, it will create more economic 
opportunity for everyone.
While equity valuations are quite high (by 
almost all measures, except against interest 
rates), historically, a multi-year booming 
economy could justify their current price. 
Equity markets look ahead, and they may 
very well be pricing in not only a booming 
economy but also the technical factor that 
lots of the excess liquidity will find its way 
into stocks. Clearly, there is some froth and 
speculation in parts of the market, which 
no one should find surprising. As Captain 
Louis Renault said in Casablanca, “I’m 
shocked, shocked to find that gambling is 
going on in here!”
Conversely, in this boom scenario it’s hard 
to justify the price of U.S. debt (most people 
consider the 10-year bond as the key refer-
ence point for U.S. debt). This is because of 
two factors: first, the huge supply of debt 
that needs to be absorbed; and second, the 
not-unreasonable possibility that an increase 
in inflation will not be just temporary. 
In 2020, the Federal Reserve bought essen-
tially 100% of all new issuance of Treasury 
notes and bonds. In 2021, with the Fed’s 
current QE commitments, the market (not 
the Fed) will have to absorb $2.2 trillion in 
government debt – approximately 85% of 
which will be in longer duration maturities. 
This is a large number, even for the United 
States. We should also remember that many, 
if not most, buyers of U.S. debt are essen-
tially required to buy; i.e., foreign central 
banks, banks, insurance companies, foreign 
exchange reserve managers and duration 
hedgers. A notable exception is investors 
who buy the 10-year bond to take risk-off 
positions. However, all of these buyers will 
seek out alternatives – and there are always 
some – if they become worried about the 
long-term, sustainable value of Treasury 
bonds. And remember, annual inflation is 
already running at 1.7%.
We don’t know what the future holds, and 
it is possible that we will have a Goldi-
locks moment – fast and sustained growth, 
inflation that moves up gently (but not too 
much) and interest rates that rise (but not 
too much). A booming economy makes 
managing U.S. debt much easier and makes 
it much easier for the Fed to reverse QE and 
begin raising rates – because doing so may 
cause a little market turmoil, but it will not 
stop a roaring economy. 
And, of course, being who we are, while we 
are going to hope for the Goldilocks scenario 
– and we think there is a chance for that to 
happen – we will anticipate and be prepared 
for two other negative scenarios: 1) the new 
COVID-19 variants may be more virulent and 
resistant to the vaccine, which could obvi-
ously reverse a booming economy, damage 
the equity markets and reduce interest 
rates as there is a rush to safety, and 2) the 
increase in inflation may not be temporary 
and may not be slow, forcing the Fed to raise 
rates sooner and faster than people expect. 
Much of the stimulus may very well hit 
when the economy is doing quite well. 
During the pandemic, it was appropriate that 
fiscal and monetary policy be fairly well- 
coordinated – working in concert to counter 
the pandemic-related downturn. In an infla-
tionary case, fiscal and monetary policy may 
very well be at odds. I am reminded of when 
Paul Volcker effectively raised interest rates 
by 200 basis points on a Saturday night. 
Also in this case, the cost of interest on U.S. 
debt could go up fairly dramatically making 
things a little worse. Rapidly raising rates to 
offset an overheating economy is a typical 
cause of a recession. One other negative: In 
this case, we would be going into a recession 
with an already very high U.S. deficit. 
The government did the right thing by 
moving extraordinarily quickly to stop the 
COVID-19 recession from being extremely 
damaging. If we spend this money wisely, 
react quickly to changing circumstances and 
fix many of the public policy failures that are 
outlined in the next section, we can build a 
stronger and more equitable nation.

4. The regulatory system needs to keep up with the changing world — and finish Dodd-Frank 
to get it right. 
We have a lot of experienced and hard-
working regulators in the United States and 
globally. But I’m afraid that we gave them a 
virtually impossible job. The financial world 
is complex and rapidly changing. We gave 
them a regulatory system that is slow and 
backward-looking. A few years ago, my letter 
to shareholders included a “spaghetti chart” to 
illustrate how complex the regulatory environ-
ment in the United States had become. We’re 
republishing it here to make a few points.

Complexities of the Regulatory System
Reprinted from the 2011 Chairman and CEO Letter to Shareholders

43
V.  COVID-19 AND THE ECONOMY
We have multiple regulators with overlap-
ping rulemaking, oversight and examination 
authorities. All of the agencies are indepen-
dent, and there is no one real authority that 
can coordinate all the moving parts and bridge 
differences. The Financial Stability Oversight 
Council, chaired by the U.S. Secretary of the 
Treasury, is really just a convening body – no 
one agency has the ability to adjudicate deci-
sions. Any one agency can hold up major deci-
sions – and this unnecessarily politicizes and 
slows the regulatory policymaking process.
We don’t give our regulators the political 
cover they need. Proper regulation requires a 
finely tuned, thoughtful and often-changing 
balance between competing needs and risks. 
This, in particular, puts the Federal Reserve, 
the key oversight regulator, in a terrible 
position. Monetary policy is so critical to our 
country that the Fed must necessarily subju-
gate and sacrifice regulatory policy to achieve 
its monetary policy goals. 
That said, I will look at the regulatory 
system from the regulators’ point of view 
and describe what I would want to do if I 
were in their shoes. Let’s start with basic 
regulatory principles: 
• Ensure that safety and soundness come 
first but not at the expense of maximum 
long-term growth 
• Keep the banks funding their clients 
through the inevitable downturns and crises
• Create a fairly level international playing 
field (we don’t need to see perfection here, 
but it needs to be fair)
• Constantly assess emerging risk to the 
system
Dodd-Frank worked.
While Dodd-Frank included a lot of things that 
had nothing to do with safety and soundness 
and the Great Recession, to be fair, it accom-
plished its basic objectives – higher levels and 
quality of capital and liquidity, more strin-
gent stress testing, strong resolution capabil-
ities and better governance that created a far 
healthier banking system, which we’ve just 
seen. Nothing like what happened to the banks 
in the Great Recession can happen again. 
But it’s bogged down in the past — it needs to 
focus on the future. 
It is obvious, however, that we are bogged 
down. Ten years after the financial crisis, 
we still have not put the finishing touches 
on Basel III (aka Basel IV). And it’s not clear 
when it’s finished if it will be an international 
level playing field. In addition, there are 
many things that need to be recalibrated. For 
example, we have not corrected mortgage 
rules to make mortgages more accessible to 
more Americans. 
Not only are we slow in dealing with the 
past, but it distracts us from dealing with 
the future. There are serious emerging issues 
that need to be dealt with – and rather 
quickly: the growth of shadow banking, the 
legal and regulatory status of cryptocurren-
cies, the proper and improper use of financial 
data, the tremendous risk that cybersecurity 
poses to the system, the proper and ethical 
use of AI, the effective regulation of payment 
systems, disclosures in private markets, and 
effective regulations around market structure 
and transparency (payment for order flow, 
high-frequency trading and exchanges).
We need to actively decide what we want in the 
regulatory system.
Regulators need to decide what they want 
included in the regulatory system – and 
what they don’t want included. They can 
do this by product and by service; however, 
to do so, they need to apply the same rules 
to everyone. We need to recognize that if a 
regulated system has higher capital require-
ments than the market demands, then the 
product will move outside of the regulated 
system. If we are going to do this, we should 
do it deliberately and with aforethought. 
Today, there are extensive differences 
between the requirements placed on banks 
versus nonbanks engaging in the same 
activity. I will give one example of the impact 
of market capital versus regulatory capital. 
Under standardized capital, whether we 
44
V.  COVID-19 AND THE ECONOMY
44
make a AA loan or a BB loan, approximately 
10% of equity capital is required to support it 
(plus other expensive debt). In the nonbank 
market, institutions and securitizations can 
possibly finance the investment grade debt 
effectively with 5% equity capital. Ironically, 
this pushes high-grade credit out of banks 
and incentivizes more risky lending. 
We need to calibrate how much liquidity and 
capital should be required for banks in a way that 
balances what you want in the regulatory system 
while maximizing both safety and soundness of 
banks and the growth of the economy.
One day, someone is going to ask why the 
banking system has $4 trillion either in 
the form of cash or deposits at the Fed or 
as Treasury securities. Shouldn’t we use 
some of this liquidity to help the economy 
grow? It’s a good question, and I’ve yet to 
see agreement on the right answer. Under 
the old regulatory regime, banks could turn 
to the Fed’s discount window to create a 
tremendous amount of liquidity by pledging 
their securities and loans at times of surging 
demand – it no longer works this way. In 
today’s regime, using the discount window is 
so stigmatized that far fewer banks consider 
it a viable option, meaning that liquidity 
never reaches the banking system and, by 
default, the broader economy.
This calibration will be one of the main 
factors in determining what ends up in the 
regulatory system – and what doesn’t. It is a 
fine balance. Too much capital and liquidity 
could possibly slow down the economy and 
push lots more to the shadow banking system. 
Too little capital and liquidity could make 
banks riskier and more subject to failure. 
And remember, products and services inside 
a well-regulated system will generally have 
higher scrutiny, transparency and reporting 
supporting them. This decision will be a key 
factor in determining the probability of a large 
bank’s failure, which raises the question …
Should large banks be allowed to fail?
It is very easy to take one side of this argu-
ment. After the Great Recession of 2008, 
the answer was generally “never again!” 
The system was rebuilt to minimize the 
odds so that no large bank would ever fail 
again – regardless of the consequences. The 
Fed has to decide if it is willing to accept a 
large bank failure, provided that failure isn’t 
going to bring the market down or put the 
average customer in harm’s way. To me, the 
obvious answer should be “yes.” The market 
can easily absorb a bank failure, particularly 
since the government now has the tools to 
have an orderly unwind of even the largest 
financial institutions. In addition, if you look 
at the market price of bank debt, failure is 
priced in (just like all other corporates) – 
bank debt and bank preferreds are not cheap. 
The market can deal with the failure of bank 
debt – in fact, resolution maximizes the odds 
of recovering your money. The cost to the 
economy of having fail-safe banks may not 
be worth it. Dodd-Frank accomplished two 
very important things. First, the chance of a 
bank failure is dramatically lower. Second, 
and maybe more important, a failing large 
bank can be managed in a way that it does 
not affect the economy any more than any 
other large company that fails. A yoke that is 
too tight may throttle the economy.
Finally, banks need to be allowed to properly 
manage their capital to maintain any kind 
of premium in the market. Proper capital 
management means consistent dividends, 
the ability to reinvest in your business and 
incentives to buy back stock when it’s cheap 
– not when it’s expensive. The procyclicality 
of both accounting and bank regulatory 
management virtually assures the opposite. 
It is one of the reasons that bank stocks may 
not trade particularly well. 
We need to decide who we want to intermediate 
in the markets when there is stress. 
Several times in the last few years you have 
seen dislocation in our repo markets, Trea-
sury markets and, in March 2020, all of our 
markets. In many cases, the Fed has had 
to step in to intermediate and help finance 
these markets. 
Part of the reason for this is the probably 
unintended confluence of new regulations. 
We now manage our bank to try to maxi-
45
45
V.  COVID-19 AND THE ECONOMY
mize and optimize across more than 20 
capital and liquidity factors (we run the bank 
to serve customers, but we maximize capital 
and liquidity requirements for economic 
reasons). But the confluence of three main 
constraints (the LCR, the supplementary 
leverage ratio (SLR) rule and G-SIFI) created 
red lines that we cannot cross. Over the past 
two years, we saw significant dislocation in 
the U.S. Treasury (UST) repo markets, which 
were certainly linked to these regulations. At 
those moments of stress, by simply reducing 
the regulatory cost of UST repo, we could 
have supplied hundreds of billions of dollars 
in additional UST financing to the market 
(this activity would be properly collateral-
ized and very safe) – and remember, we are 
only one market player. In addition, when 
the market had high stress, we could also 
have lent hundreds of billions of dollars 
against corporate bonds, mortgage securi-
ties or equities to help market participants 
sell or deleverage in an orderly way. We did 
much of this in the Great Recession, but 
today’s new rules precluded us from taking 
these actions this time. JPMorgan Chase was 
essentially “the discount window” for the 
marketplace before Dodd-Frank – we would 
lend freely against good collateral just as the 
central bank was the discount window for 
banks in a crisis. This system is broken. 
The main point is that if large players cannot 
intermediate in markets because of regula-
tory requirements, the Fed will have to do 
it – and far more frequently than just in 
the worst crises. I do not believe that this is 
good, long-term central bank policy.
Finally, more thought should be given to how 
stress tests and buffers can and should be 
used in a financial crisis. The main question 
is when you are in the depths of a crisis, 
how do you stress test without going down a 
rabbit hole? And is that the time when bank 
boards are going to allow people to reduce 
their capital buffers? Plain and simple, coun-
tercyclical buffers do not work.
Public rhetoric and the politicization of 
complex regulations aside, proper design 
of these systems should be done to maxi-
mize the health of the U.S. economy for all. 
Overall, the banks – and, importantly, your 
bank – stand ready to do more.
5. The pandemic accelerated remote working capabilities, which will likely carry forward. 
While we are continually preparing for 
multiple business resiliency scenarios (i.e., 
data center failures, closures of cities, major 
storms, even pandemic planning), we never 
prepared for a global pandemic, which also 
entailed a large-scale shutdown of the global 
economy. And while many of our employees, 
particularly in the branches, continued to 
work on our premises every day, it was 
amazing how quickly we were able to set up 
the technology – from call centers and opera-
tions to trading and investment banking – to 
enable our employees to work from home. 
We learned that we could function virtually 
with Zoom and Cisco and maintain produc-
tivity, at least in the short run. 
The COVID-19 pandemic changed the way 
we work in many ways, but, for the most 
part, it only accelerated ongoing trends. And 
while working from home will become more 
permanent in American business, it needs to 
work for both the company and its clients. I 
believe our firm’s on-site versus remote work 
will sort out something like this: 
• Generally speaking, we envision a model 
that will find many employees working in 
a location full time. That would include 
nearly all of the employees in our retail 
bank branches, as well as jobs in check 
processing, vaults, lockbox, sales and 
trading, critical operations functions and 
facilities, amenities, security, medical staff 
and many others. 
46
V.  COVID-19 AND THE ECONOMY
46
The virtual world also presented some 
serious weaknesses. For example: 
• Performing jobs remotely is more 
successful when people know one another 
and already have a large body of existing 
work to do. It does not work as well when 
people don’t know one another. 
• Most professionals learn their job through 
an apprenticeship model, which is almost 
impossible to replicate in the Zoom world. 
Over time, this drawback could dramati-
cally undermine the character and culture 
you want to promote in your company.
• A heavy reliance on Zoom meetings actu-
ally slows down decision making because 
there is little immediate follow-up.
• And remote work virtually eliminates 
spontaneous learning and creativity 
because you don’t run into people at 
the coffee machine, talk with clients in 
unplanned scenarios, or travel to meet 
with customers and employees for feed-
back on your products and services. 
Finally, we still intend to build our new head-
quarters in New York City. We will, of course, 
consolidate even more employees into this 
building, which will house between 12,000 to 
14,000 employees. We are extremely excited 
about the building’s public spaces, state-of-
the-art technology, and health and wellness 
amenities, among many other features. It’s 
in the best location in one of the world’s 
greatest cities. 
• Some employees will be working under a 
hybrid model (e.g., some days per week in 
a location and the other days at home).
• And a small percentage of employees, 
maybe 10%, will possibly be working full 
time from home for very specific roles.
In all cases, these decisions depend upon 
what is optimal for our company and our 
clients, and we will extensively monitor and 
analyze outcomes to ensure this is the case. 
Of course, we will also continue to reopen 
following health authority and govern-
ment guidelines and our own established 
processes. Remote work will change how we 
manage our real estate. We will quickly move 
to a more “open seating” arrangement, in 
which digital tools will help manage seating 
arrangements, as well as needed amenities, 
such as conference room space. As a result, 
for every 100 employees, we may need seats 
for only 60 on average. This will significantly 
reduce our need for real estate.

Our nation is clearly under a lot of stress and 
strain from various events: the COVID-19 
pandemic, of course, which has taken more 
American lives than the total lost in World 
War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam 
War combined, resulting in acute economic 
distress for millions more; the brutal murder 
of George Floyd and the racial unrest that 
followed; the divisive 2020 presidential 
election, culminating in the storming of the 
Capitol and the attempt to disrupt our democ-
racy; and the seemingly inevitable, but none-
theless alarming and unnerving, rise of China, 
threatening America’s global preeminence. 
America has faced tough times before – the 
Civil War, World War I, the U.S. stock market 
crash of 1929 and the Great Depression that 
followed, and World War II, among others. 
As recently as the late 1960s and 1970s, we 
struggled with the loss of the Vietnam War, 
political and racial injustice, recessions, 
inflation and the emergence of Japan as an 
economic power. But in each case, Ameri-
ca’s might and resiliency strengthened our 
position in the world, particularly in relation 
to our major international competitors. This 
time may be different.
China’s leaders believe that America is in 
decline. They believe this not only because 
their country’s sheer size will make them 
the largest economy on the planet by 2030 
but also because they believe their long-term 
thinking and competent, consistent leader-
ship have outshone America’s in so many 
ways. The Chinese see an America that is 
losing ground in technology, infrastructure 
and education – a nation torn and crippled 
by politics, as well as racial and income 
inequality – and a country unable to coordi-
nate government policies (fiscal, monetary, 
industrial, regulatory) in any coherent way 
to accomplish national goals. Unfortunately, 
recently, there is a lot of truth to this. 
Perhaps we were lulled into a false sense of 
security and complacency in the last two 
decades of the 20th century as we enjoyed 
relative peace in the world and a position 
of global dominance, validated by the fall 
of the Soviet Union. During those two 
decades, we experienced relatively unin-
terrupted and strong growth, resulting in 
broad improvement in income for almost 
all Americans. That stability was shattered 
by the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, 
which were followed by nearly 20 years 
of overseas combat for American soldiers. 
Economic growth over the last two decades 
(including the Great Recession of 2008) has 
been painfully slow, with increasing income 
inequality and virtually no growth in income 
at the lower rungs of the economic ladder. 
The COVID-19 pandemic, for which our 
nation was totally unprepared, capped by 
the horrific murder of George Floyd, shoved 
into the spotlight our country’s profound 
inequities and their devastating effects – 
inequities that had been there for a long 
time. Once more, our country suffered, and 
its least well-off individuals suffered the 
most. Unfortunately, the tragedies of this 
past year are only the tip of the iceberg – 
they merely expose enormous failures that 
have existed for decades and have been 
deeply damaging to America. 
Today, the United States and other countries 
around the world are grappling with many 
other critical issues. To name just a few: 
capitalism versus other economic systems; 
access to healthcare; immigration policy; the 
role of business in our society; and how, or 
even whether, the United States intends to 
exercise global leadership. Many Americans 
have lost faith in their government’s ability 
to solve these and other problems – in fact, 
most people would describe government as 
ineffective, bureaucratic and often biased. 
Almost all institutions – governments, 
schools, media and businesses – have lost 
credibility in the eyes of the public. And

VI. PUBLIC POLICY   
AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM, COMPETITIVENESS AND LEADERSHIP: CHALLENGED BY CHINA, COVID-19 AND OUR OWN COMPETENCE
perhaps for good reason: Many of our prob-
lems have been around for a long time and 
are not aging well. Politics is increasingly 
divisive, and government is increasingly 
dysfunctional, leading to a number of poli-
cies that simply don’t work. 
Americans know that something has gone 
terribly wrong, and they blame this coun-
try’s leadership: the elite, the powerful, 
the decision makers – in government, 
in business and in civic society. This is 
completely appropriate, for who else should 
take the blame? And people are right to 
be angry and feel let down. Our failures 
fuel the populism on both the political left 
and right. But populism is not policy, and 
we cannot let it drive another round of 
poor planning and bad leadership that will 
simply make our country’s situation worse. 
To explain how and why this all happened, 
we tend to look for convenient reasons – 
some blame greed and “short-termism,” 
some blame immigration and others blame 
the uncontrolled effects of new technolo-
gies, trade or China. Many of our citizens 
are unsettled, and the fault line for all this 
discord is a fraying American dream – the 
enormous wealth of our country is accruing 
to the very few. In other words, the fault 
line is inequality. And its cause is staring us 
in the face: our own failure to move beyond 
our differences and self-interest and act for 
the greater good. The good news is that this 
is fixable. 
Some Americans think that the country’s 
can-do attitude, innovative entrepreneurism 
and great resiliency, which served us so well 
in prior crises, still exist and will re-emerge 
to help us self-correct. At the other end of the 
spectrum, there are those who think we are 
simply a great empire whose glory days have 
passed and we should cede global leadership 
to China. These advocates would add that 
democracy itself does not work – our failures 
being prime evidence of democracy’s ineffec-
tiveness. Both views fall short. 
The problems that are tearing at the fabric of 
American society require all of us – govern-
ment, business and civic society – to work 
together with a common purpose. And that 
common purpose should be our ongoing 
quest to be a more perfect union and to 
maintain America’s preeminent role in the 
world. To do this, we need to demand more 
of both ourselves and of our leaders. And we 
can’t fix our problems if we don’t acknowl-
edge them and the damage they have caused. 
Hoping that things will self-correct is not a 
strategy – working on solutions is. 
One last thing: The raw power of America is 
often represented by our incredible military 
might. In reality, however, our raw power 
emanates from our economic vitality and 
strength, which have always been predi-
cated upon freedom, free enterprise, and the 
promise of increasing equality and opportu-
nity for all. If income inequality is the fault 
line, returning to the basic morality at the 
core of America’s founding principles can 
lead us to a common purpose and help bind 
us together again. 
49
VI. PUBLIC POLICY

both the federal and state levels. We have 
failed to put effective immigration policies 
in place; our social safety nets are poorly 
designed; and we fail to properly fund 
pension obligations. The growth in American 
incomes from 1980 to 2000 was healthy, and 
for the lowest and second-lowest quintiles, it 
was 18% and 19%, respectively, both cumula-
tively and inflation-adjusted. Growth slowed 
dramatically in the decades from 2000 to 
2019, but it was the worst for the lower two 
quintiles, which were up only 1% and 8%, 
respectively. Income inequality has gotten 
worse. Nearly 30% of American workers earn 
less than $15 an hour, which is barely a living 
wage even if two adults are working in a 
family of four. Another key driver of growth 
has dropped over the past 20 years: Labor 
force participation of prime working age men 
peaked at 92% in 2000; in 2020, it was 88%. 
If we returned to the peak year, 2 million 
more men would be working. (An estimated 
1.6 million Americans were addicted to 
opioids in 2019, which some studies show is 
one of the major reasons why men aged 25-54 
are permanently out of work.)
In addition, 30% of Americans don’t have 
enough savings to deal with unexpected 
expenses that total as little as $400, such as 
medical or car repair bills. This obviously 
adds to the economic anxiety of our lower-
paid people. 
Trillions of government dollars were spent 
on social programs even before these latest 
crises – clearly, our broken systems leave too 
many of our fellow citizens trapped. Simply 
put, the social needs of far too many of our 
citizens are not being met. And, surprisingly, 
approximately 25% of those eligible for 
various types of federal assistance programs 
don’t get the help to which they’re entitled. 
What actually are our problems? If we can 
agree on what they are, as well as their 
symptoms and their causes, then we can start 
to address them. I hope you find what I’m 
about to say as painful as I do. 
While the average American high school 
graduates approximately 85% of its students, 
many of our inner city schools don’t grad-
uate half of their students and often don’t 
give our children an education that leads 
to a livelihood. No one can claim that the 
promise of equal opportunity is being 
offered to all Americans through our educa-
tion systems. Our healthcare system is 
increasingly costly – now over $11,000 per 
person, more than twice our global compet-
itors. In addition, almost a decade after the 
adoption of the Affordable Care Act, over 
30 million Americans still don’t have any 
medical insurance. And, shockingly, life 
expectancy has gotten worse – particularly 
for poor and minority communities – nutri-
tion and personal health aren’t being taught 
at enough schools, and obesity, a main driver 
of diabetes, cancer, stroke, heart disease and 
depression, has become a national scourge. 
Our education and health issues come 
together in this alarming statistic: Seventy 
percent of today’s youth (ages 17-24) are 
not eligible for military service, essentially 
due to a lack of proper education (basic 
reading and writing skills) or health issues 
(commonly obesity or diabetes). 
Of course, there’s a litany of other problems. 
I’ll give some examples, but if I tried to 
address them all, this letter would become 
a book. We have a litigation and regula-
tory system that is costly, crippling small 
businesses with red tape and bureaucracy; 
terrible infrastructure planning and invest-
ment; and huge waste and inefficiency at 
1. Laying out the problems is painful.

VI. PUBLIC POLICY

would have driven wages higher and given 
us the wherewithal to broadly build a better 
country. Tax receipts would have been 
higher, and we easily could have afforded 
better social safety nets. 
Anemic growth may account for our wors-
ening productivity and income inequality. 
Included among the common explanations 
for this growth is that “secular stagnation” 
is the new normal or that there is a “savings 
glut.” Faster growth would not only have 
spurred higher incomes, more jobs and 
increased opportunities but also would have 
created far more consumption and increased 
demand for investment, eliminating any 
potential “savings glut” or secular stagnation. 
It is hard to look at these issues in their 
totality and not conclude that they have a 
significant negative effect on the great Amer-
ican economic engine. My view is if you add 
it all up, this dysfunction could easily have 
been a 1% drag on our growth rate. And, 
unfortunately, our extraordinary strengths as 
a nation cover up our weaknesses. This is the 
new normal – and it does not need to be this 
way. We should first look at how and why we 
became so inept at public policy.
2. Why did — and didn’t — these failures happen? 
Before we discuss how to fix our problems, 
it would be helpful to understand why some 
of them happened – and why we failed to 
design and implement good public policies. 
Clearly, increasing political partisanship – 
possibly structural – deserves part of the 
blame, but I’ll leave that subject to others. It’s 
also clear that our failings are not deliberate 
since no one wants these terrible outcomes. 
What has changed, however, is the scale 
of our challenges: They are bigger, global 
and increasingly complex, and they are 
happening in a world that is transforming 
itself far more rapidly than before. History 
teaches us that as a successful society ages, 
the common social purpose that binds it 
becomes less important. Instead, the society 
becomes more balkanized and often is crip-
pled by powerful agendas of special interest 
groups – even if they all have good inten-
tions. Let’s examine some of the reasons why 
we have failed to design effective policies. 
We are hampered by short-term thinking that’s 
never comprehensive. 
As a nation, we don’t think long term, which 
hampers our ability to design proper policies 
that are based on thoughtful analysis. In 
my view, we don’t perform the deep analysis 
required to fully understand what we’re 
trying to solve. One of the reasons for this 
is that our outlook is often too limited; i.e., 
examining only how things have changed 
Governments, both federal and state, fight to 
keep military bases open that we don’t need 
and Veterans Affairs hospitals functioning 
that are broken – making the military more 
costly and less effective. Our shortcom-
ings are not just about inefficiencies; they 
border on being immoral. In an incredibly 
depressing story, former Secretary of Defense 
Bob Gates describes how Congress took 
years longer than it should have to approve 
the building of U.S. Army personnel carriers 
that we needed in Iraq and Afghanistan to 
protect our soldiers from improvised explo-
sive devices. While we dallied, many of our 
soldiers died or received terrible lifelong 
injuries. Although the government does 
certain things well, no one believes that it 
does most things well or that it gives an 
honest accounting of what it does do. We 
merely throw up our hands in frustration. 
All of this broken policy may explain why, 
over the last 10 years, the U.S. economy has 
grown cumulatively only about 18%. Some 
think that this sounds satisfactory, but it 
must be put into context: In prior sharp 
downturns (1974, 1982 and 1990), economic 
growth was 40% over the ensuing 10 years. 
Had we had 20% more growth, our GDP 
would have added $3 trillion, which certainly 
51
VI. PUBLIC POLICY  
AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM, COMPETITIVENESS AND LEADERSHIP: CHALLENGED BY CHINA, COVID-19 AND OUR OWN COMPETENCE
year-over-year or even quarter-over-quarter. 
We frequently fail to look at trends over a 
multi-year period or across decades – and we 
miss the forest for the trees. 
When you step back and take a comprehen-
sive multi-year view, considering the situa-
tion in its totality, it is the cumulative effect 
of many of our policies that has resulted in 
our present-day failures. 
We are over-reliant on economic models and use 
them inappropriately. 
Economic models are a great discipline that 
force you to think through the interplay of 
many factors, often over many years. Unfor-
tunately, however, a lot of people use models 
like they do certain facts: to justify what they 
already believe. While we should definitely 
use models as tools, they should not be deter-
minative, as they simply cannot account for 
much of humankind.
Certain pivotal factors are too complex or 
qualitative to incorporate into a model. In 
evaluating a company or the economy, for 
example, models quite often fail to prop-
erly account for culture and morality, the 
character of players involved, the increasing 
importance of education and skills, the value 
of dignity of work, the power of self-confi-
dence as a secret sauce and the emergence of 
new technologies, just to name a few. 
Even worse, many models use inputs that 
are so inaccurate that their outputs cannot 
be remotely relied upon. For instance, 
accounting itself (particularly government 
accounting) may be the worst culprit. 
Good investments are treated as expenses 
(including education, R&D and infrastruc-
ture) – indistinguishable from incarcera-
tion costs and homelessness. And incred-
ibly, federal government budgeting rules, 
like PAYGO (or Pay-As-You-Go) or budget 
caps, mandate that many expenses have to 
be offset by revenue increases or have to 
be traded off against other priorities. The 
economy is frustratingly complex, and many 
times overusing models devalues basic 
commonsense. 
We cloud debate with unfair thinking and 
arguing.
One of the best pieces of advice I have ever 
received was that people should use their 
intelligence to seek out the answers, not to 
justify what they already think or to win 
the argument. Here are some of the favorite 
tricks people use to win the argument and 
obviate issues:
• Presenting issues as if they are binary. 
This is a habit of sloppy thinking. Two 
of my favorite quotes illuminate this. 
One by Albert Einstein: “Everything 
should be made as simple as possible, 
but not simpler.” And the second by H.L. 
Mencken: “For every complex problem 
there is an answer that is clear, simple and 
wrong.” We frequently seek out conve-
nient and simplistic answers, which are 
often wrong. The same is true for how 
we listen. Instead, we should try to find 
common ground with parts of someone’s 
argument as opposed to rejecting the 
entirety of it offhand.
• Creating and blaming scapegoats like trade, 
China, immigration or capitalism. While 
scapegoating is easy, it mostly hides 
the truth – in fact, when you dig a little 
deeper (which we do in the following 
pages), other causes, possibly self-inflicted, 
become clear. 
• Unfairly assigning motives to people, which 
may or may not be true. The goal is simply 
to denigrate an individual and/or win an 
argument – but this tactic has nothing to 
do with the actual facts.
• Creating strawmen (representing your 
opponent). This strategy makes it easier to 
attack foes for things they did not actually 
think or say.
Media hype and people’s willingness to be 
weaponized derail thoughtful strategies.
Much has been said about the role of social 
media, but some things are clear. Most media 
and individuals barely have time to focus 
on the issues – and often default to overly 
52
VI. PUBLIC POLICY   
AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM, COMPETITIVENESS AND LEADERSHIP: CHALLENGED BY CHINA, COVID-19 AND OUR OWN COMPETENCE
simplistic, binary and incorrect conclusions 
that neatly fit into false political narratives. 
The urgency of today and the hyperactive 
and frequently hysterical focus on irrelevant 
issues crowd out thoughtful strategy and 
policy for tomorrow. Lack of civility and 
humility make it hard to work together and 
to respect each other. Moral indignation is 
blinding – it stops you from trying to agree 
on what the problems are; it disguises itself 
as policy, and it turns expertise into elitism. 
I am often surprised how people allow 
themselves to be completely riled up – yes, 
it happens to me, too. And when politics and 
media meet, we are whipsawed by false argu-
ments of fanatics, the certitude of ideologues 
and cycles of intolerance. We all should try 
not to be drawn into this vortex.
We are stymied by self-interest, selfishness, 
and the buildup of bureaucratic plaque and 
institutional sclerosis.
Now willingly, I’m about to go down a 
slippery slope. I’m going to cite some very 
specific examples, but I essentially apply 
them to all of us and make my point as 
simply and strongly as possible: We are 
bogged down, sometimes crippling our 
nation, because of self-interest and the asso-
ciated bureaucracy and bad thinking that 
follow. Much of this is not done deliberately 
– it’s just built up over time – like arterio-
sclerosis. Historians sometimes point to this 
disease as a cause of the decline and fall of 
great empires.
This self-interest is virtually everywhere. 
There are 17,000 registered lobbyist contracts 
for special interest groups in Washington, 
D.C., including business-related groups and 
banking and financial services. We all deserve 
our share of the blame for using the balkan-
ized government, bureaucracy and lack of 
transparency to further our own interests – 
not necessarily the country’s. This includes 
business, unions, state and local governments, 
and individuals. All of us failed to properly 
heed President John F. Kennedy’s appeal: 
“Ask not what your country can do for you – 
ask what you can do for your country.”
For years, business, government and commu-
nity leaders, including myself, voiced 
concerns about the inequities and other 
crises in our economy and communities. 
Business did not cause many of these soci-
etal issues – large companies, generally, pay 
their workers a higher-than-average salary, 
offer more training, provide more extensive 
insurance and medical and pension bene-
fits for their employees and fundamentally 
drive our country’s growth and competi-
tiveness, as these companies account for 
approximately 80% of capital expenditures 
and R&D. Frankly, we punted too much of 
the responsibility to our government. But 
we are partly responsible – for we priori-
tized shareholder interests and sometimes 
narrow self-interests over creating broader 
opportunity for all in America. Successful 
businesses can literally and figuratively 
“drive by” our worst problems (think inner 
cities) and still thrive. These large companies 
can and should be more aggressively part of 
the solution because they can uniquely help 
with job planning, skills training, infrastruc-
ture investment and community develop-
ment. And doing so, over the long run, is 
both morally right and commercially right 
because it will be good for business. 
State and local governments are equally to 
blame. Take, for instance, five states (Cali-
fornia, Connecticut, Illinois, New Jersey and 
New York) that continue to fight for unlim-
ited state and local tax deductions (because 
those five states reap 40% of the benefit) 
even though they are aware that over 80% 
of those deductions will accrue to people 
earning more than $339,000 a year. 
Few of our institutions are blameless. Hospi-
tals fighting to keep their prices unpublished 
and teachers’ unions arguing to continue to 
keep failed schools open are just two such 
examples. 
Then there’s our tax code – buried in it 
are an extraordinary number of loopholes, 
credits and exemptions that aren’t about 
competitiveness or good tax policy: Private 
equity, venture capital and real estate still 
53
VI. PUBLIC POLICY  
AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM, COMPETITIVENESS AND LEADERSHIP: CHALLENGED BY CHINA, COVID-19 AND OUR OWN COMPETENCE
get carried interest, and sugar and cotton, for 
some unknown reason, still get government 
subsidies. Suffice it to say, industry gets its 
share of tax breaks and forms of protection 
from legitimate competition. 
Our public policy failures are not partisan issues.
Our problems are neither Democratic nor 
Republican – nor are the solutions. Unfor-
tunately, however, partisan politics is 
preventing collaborative policy from being 
designed and implemented, particularly at 
the federal level. We would do better if we 
listened to one another. 
Democrats should acknowledge Republi-
cans’ legitimate concerns that money sent to 
Washington often ends up in large wasteful 
programs, ultimately offering little value to 
local communities. They could acknowledge 
that while we need good government, it is 
not the answer to everything. Democrats 
could also acknowledge that a healthy fear of 
a large central government is not irrational 
(like a Leviathan).
Republicans need to acknowledge that 
America can and should afford to provide a 
proper safety net for our elderly, our sick and 
our poor, as well as help create an environ-
ment that generates more opportunities and 
more income for more Americans. Republi-
cans could acknowledge that if the govern-
ment can demonstrate that it is spending 
money wisely, we should spend more – think 
infrastructure and education funding. And 
that may very well mean higher taxes for the 
wealthy. Should that happen, the wealthy 
should keep in mind that if tax monies 
improve our society and our economy, those 
same individuals will be, in effect, among the 
main beneficiaries.
Democrats and Republicans often seem to 
be ships passing in the night – with both 
parties talking at cross purposes even when 
they may share the same goals. Compro-
mise is not incompatible with democracy 
– in fact, compromise is a core principle 
of democracy. When major policies are 
enacted on a purely partisan basis (think 
healthcare and tax reform), it virtually guar-
antees decades of fighting. It’s not unrea-
sonable to think that major policies should 
be bipartisan or not at all. 
We must remember that the concepts of 
free enterprise, rugged individualism and 
entrepreneurship are not incompatible 
with meaningful safety nets and the desire 
to lift up our disadvantaged citizens. We 
can acknowledge the exceptional history of 
America and also acknowledge our flaws, 
which need redress.
Our problems are complex and frustrating — but 
they are fixable with hard work. 
If our Founding Fathers were here today, 
they would be very proud that the Constitu-
tion they enacted has survived, thrived and 
helped to build this great country. But I also 
believe they would be disappointed. Those 
leaders were students of history, society and 
economics (just read the Federalist Papers) 
and drew upon that knowledge to structure a 
government that would function properly. 
Our country would do well to study the 
successes of the rest of the world. Germany 
and Switzerland have created impressive 
work apprenticeship programs; Singapore 
has developed effective healthcare programs; 
Hong Kong has excelled with infrastruc-
ture; and some countries, with no natural 
resources and starting from terrible base-
line positions (think South Korea after the 
Korean War), have done a terrific job in 
growing their economies and lifting up all of 
their people. Another inspiring example is 
Ireland. After decades of sectarian strife and 
terrorism, a poor, male-dominated country 
was transformed. A few years ago, the 
country elected an Indian immigrant who 
is gay as Prime Minister – Ireland is now a 
melting pot with a thriving economy due to 
good government policies. Bad government 
is prevalent in some countries, and we would 
also do well to study those examples: Argen-
tina, Cuba and Venezuela, to name a few – all 
countries with tremendous natural resources 
that allowed, in the name of their people, 
their economies to be destroyed. 
54
VI. PUBLIC POLICY   
AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM, COMPETITIVENESS AND LEADERSHIP: CHALLENGED BY CHINA, COVID-19 AND OUR OWN COMPETENCE
Any economic society, not just capitalism, 
involves billions of decisions made by indi-
viduals and institutions every day. These 
interactions are complex and can operate 
in mysterious ways. Capitalism has lifted 
billions of people out of poverty. Capitalism, 
and the continuous and free movement 
of capital and, more important, of human 
talent, in the pursuit of happiness (the invis-
ible hand of Adam Smith), creates a contin-
uous exchange of information and ideas – 
and constant innovation. But, of course, capi-
talism has always had its shortcomings. Good 
government and the guardrails of properly 
designed laws and regulation have always 
been necessary for the process to work fairly 
and efficiently. 
Fixing America’s problems is going to take 
hard work. But if we divide them into their 
component parts, we will find many viable 
solutions. With thoughtful analysis, common-
sense and pragmatism, there is hope. 
3. We need a comprehensive, multi-year national Marshall Plan, and we must strive for 
healthy growth.
We need a coherent, consistent national 
strategy to match the severity of the existing 
structural challenges that are driving our 
country’s racial and economic crises. Just as 
careful planning and analysis would have 
prepared us for the current pandemic, careful 
planning and analysis can address many of 
the challenges we face. These plans need to 
be comprehensive, integrated, sustainable 
and regularly reported on. If we throw a lot 
of money at infrastructure without fixing 
the regulations that cripple it, it won’t work. 
If we throw a lot of money at education but 
don’t report on the outcome (i.e., good jobs), 
we will lose credibility. Lurching from policy 
to policy and having boondoggles and special 
interest groups abound will make things 
worse. We need to do the right things and 
the hard things very competently. 
We need to recognize the essential and irre-
placeable importance of healthy growth and 
our global competitiveness. The best way 
to address our problems, and perhaps the 
only way to solve them without accelerating 
inequality further, is to promote healthy 
economic growth. A healthy growth strategy 
should be the primary economic policy of 
both political parties. Healthy growth may 
be the only way out of our current situation 
(slow income growth and rapidly increasing 
debt). We must unleash the extraordi-
nary vibrancy of the American economy. 
Economic growth will give us the where-
withal to deal with the issues stemming from 
inequality in ways that are sustainable. It is 
the engine that will drive and secure Ameri-
ca’s global leadership.
This can be a moment when we all come 
together and recognize our shared responsi-
bility – acting in a way that reflects the best 
of all of us. During this terrible COVID-19 
crisis, we are, in some ways, being forced 
to count on each other. It is moving to see 
the respect and gratitude that most of us 
now show our essential workers – and that 
is something we should do for all of our 
workers, all of the time. This crisis also 
reminds us that we all live on one planet. 
Let’s hope that civility, humanity and 
empathy will drive us forward toward the 
goal of improving America. We have the 
resources, and the solutions are there – just 
waiting to be found.

4. We need to take specific action steps.
In this section, I offer my views and anal-
ysis on specific solutions to our problems. 
Neither the diagnosis nor the proposed cures 
are purely my own. Our nation’s issues have 
been studied intensively by many people 
with deep knowledge. And given the space 
and other constraints of this letter, I admit to 
violating Einstein’s maxim about simplicity. 
I do make some of these issues simpler than 
they are, sometimes by giving only conclu-
sions instead of providing reasoned analysis. 
In the following pages, we review 15 policies 
(many of which, of course, are interrelated) 
where we believe we need to – and can do – 
a far better job. We would do all of them if 
we could, but fixing even some of them will 
make a significant difference. 
Training for Jobs: We need to build an education 
system that includes training for skills that lead 
to good jobs (and this will improve labor force 
participation). 
Our high schools and community colleges 
(and all colleges) need to provide our youth 
with training for certified and apprenticed 
skills that lead to good paying jobs. With 
nearly 7 million job openings and 10 million 
workers unemployed in the United States, 
creating an effective training and retraining 
program is a high-impact opportunity. Busi-
ness must be involved in this process, and 
it needs to be coordinated locally because 
that is where the actual jobs are. Proper 
training and retraining mean being sensitive 
to our rapidly changing technological world. 
Expanding digital skills and training oppor-
tunities for workers and students will be 
critical, as the pace of AI will likely accelerate 
to meet future business demands and foster 
innovation in high-risk jobs, especially across 
healthcare and the supply chain. Many 
students in our high schools and colleges 
are unaware that, with a little bit of training, 
they can qualify for jobs paying $65,000 or 
more a year. You can major in philosophy or 
history, but taking a few courses in coding 
will help to ensure you a good job. Our 
education system should bear responsibility 
for our children to graduate with an educa-
tion that leads to a good livelihood.
Germany has one of the strongest educa-
tion and training systems in the world, 
with about 1.3 million young people annu-
ally participating in paid apprenticeship 
programs that provide them opportunities to 
gain in-demand skills along with an educa-
tion. Vocational school and apprenticeship 
programs work directly with local businesses 
to ensure students are connected to avail-
able jobs upon graduation. Germany’s youth 
unemployment rate is one of the lowest in 
the world. 
Many companies have numerous jobs for 
which a “college degree is required,” but 
this often turns out to be unnecessary and 
even harmful. Much more can be done in 
terms of making a degree requirement truly 
relevant for specific jobs. Over 80 Busi-
ness Roundtable member companies – and 
counting – are participating in a new multi-
year targeted effort to reform companies’ 
hiring and talent management practices to 
emphasize the value of skills, rather than 
just degrees, and to improve equity, diver-
sity and workplace culture. The initiative 
will support measures that address inequity 
in employment practices, including how 
people are hired and how they advance, and 
it will work toward eliminating bias that may 
prove to be a barrier to hiring and advance-
ment. According to a recent study, employers 
frequently require a four-year college degree 
for 74% of new jobs in America – this 
screening excludes roughly two-thirds of 
American workers, and its impact is most 
pronounced on minority applicants.
In addition to the Business Roundtable 
initiative, companies are partnering with 
educators in regions throughout the country. 
For example, in New York City, the New 
York Jobs CEO Council is working with 
City University of New York (CUNY) to 
develop new two-year associate degrees.

VI. PUBLIC POLICY

ment rates, to make further adjustments. 
Simply stated, our policy goals should focus 
on maximizing incentives to get more people 
working while minimizing incentives for 
employers to lay off workers, especially 
low-paid employees. 
Second, we should ensure that federal efforts, 
like the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and 
the Child Tax Credit, are effective enough so 
that every job essentially pays a living wage. 
The higher wages resulting from these credits 
would go a long way toward improving our 
labor force participation, which is a key driver 
of productivity and economic growth. 
Opportunities for Jobs: We need to make it 
easier for those with a criminal record to get 
a job (which will also improve labor force 
participation). 
We need to reduce recidivism, reform the 
criminal justice system and eliminate barriers 
to a good job. One such barrier is a criminal 
record, which one in three adults (more than 
70 million people) in our country has. Our 
criminal justice system disproportionately 
impacts people of color – Black adults are over 
five times more likely to be incarcerated than 
white adults. This is institutional racism in its 
clearest form. Reforms to the criminal justice 
system and business screening and hiring 
practices can open the door of opportunity to 
significantly more people. JPMorgan Chase 
supported a measure signed into federal law 
in 2020 restoring access to Pell Grants for 
incarcerated individuals, which allows them to 
pursue postsecondary education in prison and 
increase employment opportunities after their 
release. Other steps that we can – and must 
– take are: adopting “ban the box” measures 
for employment applications and reforming 
clean slate laws so anyone with a record of 
minor offenses can more easily qualify for a 
job. JPMorgan Chase has taken many of these 
steps, and, in 2020 alone, we hired more than 
2,000 people with a criminal background.
America believes in second chances and 
redemption. Getting a second chance will 
give people dignity and enable them to earn 
a higher lifetime income while reducing 
recidivism and all of its related costs. 
These degrees are explicitly designed to 
enable students to graduate with a market-
able college degree (and paid apprenticeship 
experience) in two years, debt free and with 
an employment opportunity in an in-demand, 
high-potential field of their choosing. 
One last point: Although there are wide 
variations across the United States, teachers 
in public institutions, on average, earn 
33% less than their peers with equivalent 
degrees (college level and above) – this is the 
lowest ratio in the OECD (Organisation for 
Economic Co-operation and Development). 
While we should attack waste in the system, 
we should pay teachers more money and 
base their salaries upon clear standards that 
will measure success – not just graduation 
rates and standardized test scores but certi-
fication of skills – and lead to actual good 
paying jobs.
Paying for Jobs: We need to improve wages for 
low-skilled work (again, this would improve labor 
force participation). 
Decades ago, an unskilled worker, who may 
not have graduated from high school but 
was willing to work hard, could get a job 
at a manufacturing plant that would soon 
lead to a living wage and the ability to earn 
a middle-class income. That may no longer 
be the case. Today, it may be that unskilled 
or low-skilled workers would not natu-
rally earn a living wage. All jobs are good 
jobs: They bring dignity; people who start 
working generally continue working; and 
the first job is often the first rung on the 
employment ladder. Jobs also lead to better 
social outcomes – less crime, more household 
formation and less mental illness.
While a living wage differs by state, the 
national average is currently $68,000 a year 
for a family of four. With two adults working 
full time, each would need to earn $16.50 an 
hour to reach that level. We should strive 
to make every job generate a living wage – 
and do two things to accomplish this goal. 
First, we should, at the very least, increase 
the federal minimum wage and allow states, 
based on local conditions and unemploy-
57

AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM, COMPETITIVENESS AND LEADERSHIP: CHALLENGED BY CHINA, COVID-19 AND OUR OWN COMPETENCE
We need to reform and improve our social safety 
net programs (which can also improve labor force 
participation). 
Our varied and various public assistance 
programs (Medicaid, food assistance, income 
support, unemployment, housing and util-
ities benefits for individuals who cannot 
work, due to disability or childcare respon-
sibilities, to name a few) are a complete 
mishmash of uncoordinated federal, state 
and local policies. People qualifying for 
public benefits may be eligible for various 
programs but often don’t apply because 
they are unaware, ill-informed or unable to 
navigate the complexities. These programs 
frequently have different applications and 
application processes, including different 
places to apply, with benefits often disap-
pearing at different income levels and at 
different speeds. It is accurate to say that 
the complexity and variability in eligibility 
rules have negative consequences for both 
program administration and access to 
assistance. For example, beneficiaries often 
have to provide the same information for 
different federal programs and visit multiple 
offices in order to apply. The Government 
Accountability Office has provided reports 
about this maze of programs to Congress; 
in addition, the Center on Budget and Policy 
Priorities has created guides for state and 
local use to help streamline the application 
and enrollment process, utilizing eligibility 
determinations made by other programs to 
jump-start approvals. 
Public assistance programs need to be 
coordinated, consolidated and connected 
to trends in the larger economy, as well as 
to the individual’s transition to employ-
ment. For example, unemployment insur-
ance should have automatic stabilizers that 
increase benefits when and where jobs are 
lacking and reduce them when and where 
jobs are abundant. Application to all social 
welfare benefits should be available through 
one single form and phased in and phased 
out on a common grid, not on a cliff. Coordi-
nated with an individual’s transition to work, 
benefits should gradually be reduced, making 
them a true safety net.
Finally, providing affordable childcare 
programs or lowering the starting age for 
public school would make it far easier for 
parents to work. Some countries are now 
implementing universal access to preschool 
for children at three years of age. This is a 
wonderful policy. It makes childcare less 
expensive and has proved to be extraordi-
narily good for student education over the 
short and long term. Parents like it, too. Of 
course, the benefits may not be fully realized 
for years, but this is precisely the type of 
long-term thinking in policymaking that we 
need. Women, in particular, suffered in the 
COVID-19 crisis as an estimated 2.5 million 
left the workplace, largely because they had to 
become full-time caregivers for their children 
or elderly parents. Many of the programs 
listed above will make it easier for women to 
return to the workforce if they so choose.
We need to try to make the healthcare 
system work better (better health drives both 
productivity and labor force participation). 
We have the best healthcare in the world in 
terms of doctors, hospitals, and pharmaceu-
tical and medical device companies, but we 
certainly do not have the best outcomes. As 
I discussed earlier, 30 million Americans do 
not have any insurance; obesity, high blood 
pressure, asthma, diabetes and other condi-
tions are rampant; and costs are far too high 
with little transparency into their calculation. 
Annual medical costs per person in the United 
States are now $11,000 versus $4,000 for other 
developed nations. There are ways we can 
make significant improvements. Here are a 
few: allow bigger incentives for becoming 
and staying healthy; eliminate bureaucracy 
and waste in the healthcare system, including 
administrative complexity and fraud (this 
represents approximately 25% of total health-
care spending in the United States); empower 
employees to make better choices through 
more transparent employer plan pricing and 
options that include the actual cost of medical 
procedures; eliminate surprise bills (these 
usually come from unexpected out-of-network 
services); develop better corporate wellness 
programs that target obesity and smoking; 
create better tools to enable comparison shop-
58

AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM, COMPETITIVENESS AND LEADERSHIP: CHALLENGED BY CHINA, COVID-19 AND OUR OWN COMPETENCE
ping for nonemergency care and help manage 
healthcare expenses; and reduce the extraor-
dinary expense for unwanted end-of-life care. 
There should be national, not state-by-state, 
insurance exchanges, which would be far 
more efficient. And exchanges should also 
offer a low-cost, catastrophic-only insurance 
package as an option. Plus all healthcare data 
should belong to the individual, not to various 
healthcare companies. Another obvious incen-
tive is to dramatically enhance how effectively 
wellness, nutrition, health and exercise are 
taught in K-12 classrooms nationwide.
We need proper, rigorous and multi-year 
budgeting, planning and reporting. 
Companies perform extensive budgeting, 
planning and reporting, some of it conducted 
on a multi-year basis. Real investments – in 
training, data centers, manufacturing plants 
and other categories – are needed on a multi-
year basis and cannot be stopped and started 
without incurring enormous additional costs. 
But this stopping and starting is exactly what 
takes place in the federal government, which 
inevitably leads to waste and inefficiency. 
One striking example: The military esti-
mates that it spends more money per year 
on procurement than is necessary because of 
this inefficiency. In total, the stop-start nature 
of our government’s budgeting processes 
most certainly costs us tens of billions of 
dollars a year in complete waste. 
Proper budgeting and planning – on a 
multi-year basis – should be implemented 
at all levels of government. It is particularly 
important that most federal programs – 
think military, infrastructure and education 
– have good long-term plans and be held 
accountable to execute them. 
When the government talks about spending 
money, it should not lead with the amount 
spent or budgeted to be spent – as if that’s 
the measure of success. Instead, the expected 
outcome of the spending and then the actual 
outcome should be described. We desperately 
need honest and transparent accounting, 
accountability and evaluation about every-
thing we fund with government dollars. Every 
department should have an outcome report.
It would be beneficial to review government 
accounting practices and look for a better 
way to differentiate between investments 
and expenses, for instance. There are also 
examples that show it would be good if the 
government conformed to public company 
accounting, particularly around how it 
accounts for loans and guarantees. 
An honest accounting would go a long way 
to rebuilding trust in government – and in 
government spending.
We need proper management and periodic review 
of regulatory red tape and bureaucracy. 
The American can-do system is now being 
bogged down in a maze of regulatory red tape 
and bureaucracy. All you need to do is to take 
10 small business owners out to lunch and 
ask them what they need to do to meet local, 
state and federal regulations, and you will 
understand the problem. And while we all 
want a legal system that brings justice to all 
our citizens, our litigation system now costs 
1.6% of GDP, 1% more than what it costs in 
the average OECD nation. And most business-
people think that it is excessively litigious, 
slow, and somewhat arbitrary and capricious. 
One example, which works in many other 
countries, is to have the losing party pay in 
some circumstances. Clearly, this would have 
to be done in such a way as to ensure that the 
aggrieved parties are not denied appropriate 
access to our justice system. 
The cost of the now over 1 million federal 
regulations is estimated at approximately 
$14,000 per household. And while we want 
good regulations and good “guardrails,” 
there is an excessive amount of licensing, 
paperwork, employment laws and insurance 
requirements, and anyone who deals with 
the application process knows how wasteful 
and unnecessary it can be. Red tape like this 
cripples small businesses and, worse, reduces 
the formation of new enterprises. Very 
often local regulations are simply a form of 
low-level corruption in which bureaucrats 
are paid to slowly … move … paper … around.
Smart regulation includes continual 
improvement, constant cost-benefit anal-
ysis and a review of purpose and objectives, 
59
VI. PUBLIC POLICY  
AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM, COMPETITIVENESS AND LEADERSHIP: CHALLENGED BY CHINA, COVID-19 AND OUR OWN COMPETENCE
which are reported honestly. Bad regula-
tion often stifles competition – think of the 
airlines and telecom industries before they 
were deregulated. 
Here are few examples. The Federal Avia-
tion Administration is unable to adopt new 
technology for air traffic control, which most 
of the world has already adopted, that would 
reduce the average flight time by more than 
10 minutes and reduce greenhouse gases by 
12%. President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s Feder-
al-Aid Highway Act of 1956 was 29 pages long 
and originally authorized $25 billion for the 
construction of the interstate highway system 
during a 13-year period, creating a 41,000-
mile interstate highway network. And 13 
years later, the interstate highway system was 
largely built. Fast forward to current times, it 
took 10 years and 47 local, state and federal 
approvals to rebuild the Bayonne Bridge 
connecting Staten Island and New Jersey, 
which was badly in need of replacement and 
was, in fact, quite dangerous to cross. If this 
is the way we are going to go about fixing our 
infrastructure, we will never get it done. And 
it’s not just the time element – long delays 
increase the costs and risks involved. 
We need to properly invest, on an ongoing basis, 
in modernizing infrastructure. 
Virtually everyone agrees that we have done 
a woefully inadequate job investing in our 
infrastructure – from highways, ports and 
water systems to airport modernization 
and other projects. One study examined the 
effect of poor infrastructure on efficiency 
(for example, poorly constructed highways, 
congested airports with antiquated air traffic 
control systems, aging electrical grids and 
old water pipes) and concluded this could all 
be costing us hundreds of billions of dollars 
per year. Some economists estimate that a 
proper infrastructure investment plan could 
add 0.3% growth annually to our GDP – and 
it would improve competitiveness across 
many industries while opening up new 
investment opportunities. 
Such a plan would also create many new jobs 
with competitive salaries and spur workforce 
innovation. It could intentionally provide 
employment opportunities for disadvantaged 
and young workers, including those with a 
criminal background. There are many efficient 
ways to properly build and finance infrastruc-
ture, from the local, state and federal level 
or public-private partnerships, which have 
the added benefit of increasing the invest-
ment discipline. It is important to point out, 
however, that building ineffective “bridges to 
nowhere” while temporarily creating jobs is 
actually a huge value destructor. This kind of 
waste would ultimately undermine Ameri-
cans’ faith in our system.
We need proper and consistent tax and fiscal 
policy — done right, it can actually help drive 
healthy growth and improve income equality. 
It would be good to have a tax and fiscal 
strategy, which is premised upon maxi-
mizing healthy growth and redistributing 
income effectively. It would include the 
following features:
1.  A system that is consistent, highly trans-
parent and as simple as possible.
2.  A tax collection system that enables collec-
tion of all taxes owed. My view is that 
everyone should pay the taxes they owe, 
and it should be strictly enforced. Many 
estimates project that with increased head-
count and greater input from data scien-
tists, we could collect between $30 billion 
and $100 billion more per year. 
3.  A target for what the federal government 
should expect to collect in taxes over time. 
A good starting point would be 18% of 
GDP (it has been running at an average 
of about 16% over the last decade). In 
good times, we should run a small surplus 
(~1%), and in bad times, we should have 
a small deficit (~4%-5%), such that debt 
to GDP stays fairly constant over time. A 
side benefit of this is that the government 
would know that it would have more 
money to spend – but only if we grow.
We should think about good taxes and bad 
taxes in terms of spurring growth. Taxing 
primary capital formation or labor are 
growth reducers. Having capital retained 
and reinvested in the United States should 
60
VI. PUBLIC POLICY   
AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM, COMPETITIVENESS AND LEADERSHIP: CHALLENGED BY CHINA, COVID-19 AND OUR OWN COMPETENCE
be a sine qua non for healthy growth, and 
that means that our business tax rates should 
be globally competitive. Today, the average 
corporate tax rate for OECD nations is 
around 22% versus our 21%. The retention 
and reinvestment by businesses of capital in 
the United States is ultimately the primary 
driver of productivity and growth. Even if 
that capital is distributed in dividends or 
stock buybacks, it is simply being put to a 
higher and better use – this is completely 
normal capital reallocation. The free flow of 
money capital and human capital is funda-
mental to our growth and innovation (and 
fundamental to our freedoms as individuals). 
Unfortunately, taxes that minimize damage 
to growth would involve taxing high incomes. 
The wealthy are less likely to complain about 
taxes if the money is actually used to help the 
less fortunate or help build a better country. 
Even with the redistribution of income, there 
will be items that help growth and items that 
hurt growth. Redistributing income through 
the EITC will be money spent to improve 
labor force participation. Redistributing 
money to inefficient and poorly run bureau-
cracies will not improve growth. 
In addition, there is a maze of tax breaks 
in the tax code that should be eliminated. 
There are hundreds of examples, but I will 
mention just a few: carried interest, the 
special tax breaks for race cars, private jets 
and horse racing, and a special land conser-
vation tax break for golf courses. Hidden tax 
breaks have the additional stigma of being 
perceived by the American public as just 
another example of institutional bias and 
favoritism toward special interest groups. 
If the wealthy paid more in taxes and the 
money was put to good use, they would be 
the main beneficiaries of a stronger economy. 
Due to government stimulus packages as 
a result of the COVID-19 crisis, external 
government debt to GDP is now a high 
102%. We can afford that percentage and 
even more, particularly because interest rates 
are low. But in 10 to 20 years, mostly because 
of out-of-control healthcare expenses, the 
debt-to-GDP ratio will start to rise dramati-
cally – and at some point, that will become 
a problem. The sooner we deal with it, the 
better. The best way to counteract that is 
with healthy growth. After World War II, 
in 1946, the United States still had a 120% 
debt-to-GDP ratio, which over the next 10 
years fell to 60%. This was not because the 
government raised taxes or dramatically cut 
expenses but because the country grew at 
almost 4% for the decade. 
We need intelligent industrial policy.
Being a free market economy, the United 
States has never been a great believer in 
government-driven industrial policy. But we 
have done it and ought to do it intelligently 
in discrete areas that make sense (and where 
free markets alone don’t necessarily provide 
needed products or services), such as rural 
broadband, healthcare and cybersecurity. 
We also need to boost our investment in 
R&D; we’re now #8 in the world in terms 
of GDP spend on R&D. Government R&D 
could focus on AI and quantum computing, 
climate innovation and other areas. 
We need thoughtful trade policies.
The United States needs to take a leadership 
role in establishing global free and fair trade 
rules. If we don’t, they will likely be estab-
lished to the detriment of American busi-
ness. Free and fair trade rules do not have 
to be completely equivalent and reciprocal 
– just fair. Working with our allies and other 
countries, we should negotiate the gold stan-
dard of trade – not just rules around tariffs 
but fair regulations that address subsidies to 
state-controlled enterprises and other forms 
of unfair competition, bilateral investment 
and protection for intellectual property, 
among other issues.
In addition, we should recognize that trade, 
while positive for the United States as a 
whole, has caused the loss of jobs, both in 
specific geographies and in specific industries. 
Americans who have been affected by these 
disruptions need better support in terms of 
income assistance, retraining and relocation.

AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM, COMPETITIVENESS AND LEADERSHIP: CHALLENGED BY CHINA, COVID-19 AND OUR OWN COMPETENCE
We need to maintain a strong financial system. 
The United States has the best financial 
system in the world. This financial system 
encompasses asset managers, investors, banks, 
investment banks, private equity, hedge 
funds, pension plans and shadow banking. It 
is protected and enhanced by the rule of law 
(including banking laws), and it offers investor 
protections and transparency around gover-
nance and accounting and provides complete 
and free access to global investors. While 
nothing is ever perfect and can always be 
improved upon, most of the world would give 
an arm and a leg for our system. 
The free flow of credit and investments – disci-
plined capital allocation – is critical to being 
globally competitive. It is the flywheel of the 
economy as capital is seeking out good invest-
ments (across the risk spectrum) and individ-
uals and ideas that drive growth and innova-
tion. A country’s economy can hardly be better 
than its financial system and vice versa. 
The United States’ extraordinary and open 
economy gives us the extraordinary privilege 
of being the world’s reserve currency. The 
U.S. dollar is the currency of choice for the 
majority of trade transactions, and it is held 
by governments, central banks and corpora-
tions as the reserve currency (approximately 
$7 trillion, or 60% of total world reserves). 
This helps provide cheaper financing for the 
United States and gives us enormous clout 
in foreign and economic policy. However, 
we should not overly “weaponize” the dollar, 
and we should use this authority judiciously 
and in support of building a healthy, global 
economy (see accompanying feature that 
follows). 
The United States has the best financial 
system in the world, and we must strive to 
maintain it. 
While there may be faith involved, the U.S. dollar 
is the reserve currency of the world for a reason. 
First, the dollar is supported by the full faith and 
credit of the United States. The dollar, which is a 
liability of the Federal Reserve (i.e., the federal 
government) in digital or in currency form, is 
always supported by an asset — and that asset 
is generally Treasury bonds. Treasury bonds are 
supported by the full taxing authority of the U.S. 
government, which, in turn, is supported and paid 
for by the full power of the U.S. economy. These 
assets and liabilities, including the economy, are 
supported by powerful institutions, the rule of law 
and, ultimately, the full might of the U.S. military. 
Of course, a central bank can debase a currency, 
but our central bank, the Federal Reserve, is meant 
to protect the currency’s value. Faith is only a small 
part of these calculations. 
Second, and equally important, the U.S. dollar is 
the world’s reserve currency because anyone who 
legally has a U.S. dollar can move it freely around 
the world, buy and sell what they want, and invest 
in the United States. By comparison, the Chinese 
currency, the renminbi (RMB), cannot be freely 
moved around the world; it can leave China only 
in limited amounts and can be invested only as 
the Chinese see fit. It is subject to their laws and 
regulations. While the Chinese have done a good 
job building their economy and are slowly moving 
toward a more transparent society and financial 
system, they are a long way from having a currency 
that is fully “convertible” like the U.S. dollar. 
As an aside, JPMorgan Chase moves more than $8 
trillion (99% digital) a day for more than 52 million 
payments (94% digital). Approximately 98% of 
value is done the same day, 78% is done in real 
time and 20% is executed the same day. When 
these dollars are moved, they go through extensive 
screening for risk and fraud matters. While systems 
can always be improved upon, this process seems 
to be safe and efficient. 
The U.S. Dollar Is the World’s Reserve Currency for a Reason

We need proper immigration policies. 
Thirty percent of foreign students who 
receive an advanced degree in science, tech-
nology or math (300,000 students annually) 
have no legal way of staying here, although 
many would choose to do so. Most students 
from countries outside the United States 
pay full freight to attend our universities, 
but many are forced to take the skills they 
learned here back home. From my vantage 
point, that means one of our largest exports 
is brainpower. We need more thoughtful 
immigration policies that will prevent such a 
brain drain. In addition, 43% of the growth 
of our workforce over the past 10 years has 
come from immigrants. Today, we have 10 
million undocumented people living and 
working in our country; on average, they 
have resided in the United States for more 
than 15 years. Most Americans would like 
a permanent solution to DACA (Deferred 
Action for Childhood Arrivals), as well 
as a path to legal status for law-abiding, 
tax-paying undocumented immigrants. 
Americans also would like to see, and 
deserve to see, border security, and there 
would be far more support for immigration 
reform if it included proper border security. 
These issues are tearing the body politic 
apart. The Congressional Budget Office esti-
mates that the failure to pass immigration 
reform earlier this decade is costing us 0.3% 
of GDP a year. Immigration has been one of 
the great strengths of this country – and we 
should never forget that.
Affordable housing remains out of reach for too 
many Americans. 
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand 
for affordable housing significantly outpaced 
supply in nearly every U.S. county. In addi-
tion, rising home prices made it increasingly 
difficult for individuals and families to live 
near their workplace or within easy access 
to grocery stores, pharmacies and other 
essential services. There are many legisla-
tive actions that could dramatically increase 
the availability and affordability of housing 
(offering tax credits and changing local 
zoning laws are two examples). While the 
subprime mortgage crisis and the recession 
that followed were terrible, the overreac-
tion to it made housing too costly for many 
individuals (without creating more safety). 
Excessive origination, servicing and securiti-
zation requirements have increased the cost 
of the average mortgage by approximately 
20 basis points. This has mostly affected 
smaller mortgages and lower-income individ-
uals who have a slightly higher delinquent 
rate – but who still deserve a mortgage. In 
fact, J.P. Morgan analysis shows that, conser-
vatively, more than $1 trillion in additional 
loans might have been made over a five-
year period had we reformed our mortgage 
system. Our analysis also indicates that the 
cost of not reforming the mortgage markets 
could be as high as 0.2% of GDP per year. We 
believe that percentage includes an addi-
tional $500 billion a year in mortgages that 
could be written predominantly for lower-in-
come households. This alone could dramat-
ically lead to growth in America and help 
lower-income individuals build wealth. 
We need to implement several additional 
programs and policies specifically to assist Black 
and Latinx communities. 
We need to address hiring and advancement 
targets, help develop minority-owned small 
businesses and improve financial educa-
tion products for the unbanked. In addition, 
minority-owned small businesses, which 
employ nearly 9 million people and generate 
$1 trillion in annual economic output, have 
been hit especially hard by COVID-19 and 
will need serious assistance going forward, 
including capital to restart and run their 
businesses. We should consider requiring 
companies, such as grocery stores, pharma-
cies and other retailers, to provide locations 
in low-income neighborhoods, as banks 
must do (this would reduce the cost of goods 
purchased by minority individuals and 
increase local hiring and engagement). These 
efforts would be a form of redress for the 
low-income community that is sustainable 
and reinforcing.

Companies can go further by building a 
more diverse and inclusive workforce, 
including in their top ranks; tying executive 
compensation to diversity commitments; 
developing a more robust pipeline of 
diverse talent; improving supplier diversity; 
cutting ties with customers who make racist 
comments and treat employees disrespect-
fully; helping young men and women of 
color get ahead personally and profession-
ally; and increasing the diversity of busi-
nesses with whom they partner. Above all, 
it means building a company culture that 
respects and listens to everyone. Compa-
nies might not always get it right, but they 
should keep trying. The feature in The 
Path Forward in Section I outlines many of 
the specific efforts underway at JPMorgan 
Chase to help advance racial equity.
The cumulative, multi-year effect of doing just 
some of the measures mentioned above would 
lead to a healthier, more resilient and robust, and 
fairer America.
It is my belief that the underlying U.S. 
economy is so strong that it could over-
come many of the things we have failed to 
do and still grow at 2%. If we could grow 
at 3% versus 2% over a 10-year period, that 
would lead to $2.3 trillion in additional GDP 
by the end of the decade or an increase in 
household income of about $18,000. A 3% 
growth rate is what we used to have – and it 
is achievable again. This growth will help all 
Americans, but particularly poor and disad-
vantaged citizens (even before implementing 
special assistance programs) by increasing 
opportunities for better jobs, higher incomes, 
affordable housing and other benefits. 
We owe it to ourselves to restore our compet-
itiveness, our common purpose and our true 
sense of civility in the pursuit of building a 
more perfect union. 
5. America’s global role and engagement are indispensable to the health and well-being 
of America.
One of the biggest uncertainties today is 
America’s role on the world stage. A more 
secure and prosperous world is not only 
good for the rest of the world but also for 
our country’s long-term security and pros-
perity. Our role in building that more secure 
world has been, and will likely continue to 
be, indispensable. It is a complex role, and 
if we don’t fulfill it, others will – and not 
with our best interests in mind. It is even 
more complex now because since the Cold 
War, the United States has not had to deal 
with another great world power. Now we 
have the relentless rise of China, which will 
likely overtake America in the next 20 years 
as both the world’s largest economy and 
the largest financial market. Throughout 
history, the rise of a second great power has 
always been disruptive. Increasingly and 
appropriately, most of the world, including 
Americans, looks at our global position, 
particularly our economic and military 
strength, and compares it with that of China. 
There is no question that the relationship 
with (and intense competition between) the 
United States and China will be the most 
critical relationship for the next 100 years so 
it is important to deeply understand all of 
China’s strengths and weaknesses. 
China has done a good job in building its economy 
— but it still has a way to go.
Over the last 40 years, China has done a 
highly effective job of maneuvering itself to 
this point of economic development. China’s 
leadership has been strategic, consistent 
64
VI. PUBLIC POLICY   
AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM, COMPETITIVENESS AND LEADERSHIP: CHALLENGED BY CHINA, COVID-19 AND OUR OWN COMPETENCE
and coherent. And unlike developed demo-
cratic nations, it can both macromanage and 
micromanage its economy and move very 
fast. Government officials can pull, in a coor-
dinated way, fiscal, monetary and industrial 
policy levers to maintain the growth and 
employment metrics they want, and they 
have the control and wherewithal to do it. 
Unlike Western democracies that frequently, 
and increasingly, have changes in govern-
ment leadership and policy approaches, 
China’s system allows for consistent lead-
ership and consistent execution of policies 
and regulations over the long term. But their 
most important economic advantage is their 
huge home market, which they can use to 
develop their economy and their companies. 
They have, as a result, been able to use this 
home market to subsidize some very compet-
itive industries.
But in the next 40 years, the country will 
have to confront some serious issues: The 
Chinese lack enough food, water and energy 
to support their population; pollution is 
rampant; corruption continues to be a 
problem; state-owned enterprises are often 
inefficient; corporate and government debt 
levels are growing rapidly; financial markets 
lack depth, transparency and adequate rule 
of law; income inequality is higher than in 
the rest of the world; and their working age 
population has been declining since 2012. 
America’s demographics, by contrast, will 
remain strong, particularly if we continue 
to have healthy immigration. China will 
continue to face pressure from the United 
States and other Western governments over 
human rights, democracy and freedom in 
Hong Kong, and activity in the South China 
Sea and Taiwan.
Asia is a very tangled part of the world, 
geopolitically speaking. Unlike America, 
which is at peace with its neighbors and is 
protected by the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, 
many of China’s neighbors (Afghanistan, 
India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Pakistan, the 
Philippines, Russia and Vietnam) are large, 
complicated and not always friendly to China 
– in fact, China has had border skirmishes 
and wars with India, the Soviet Union and 
Vietnam since World War II. These neigh-
bors do not all look at the rise of China as 
being completely beneficial. 
Autocratic and authoritative leadership 
works well when you can manage top down 
and you are starting from a very low base. 
China’s recent success definitely has its 
leadership feeling confident. Many believe 
that America is in permanent decline and 
that democracy is failing. Regardless of 
their opinions, we should neither over- nor 
underestimate them. Only 100 million 
people in China effectively participate in the 
nation’s one-party political system. No other 
developed nation has such low participa-
tion. Growing middle classes almost always 
demand political power, which helps explain 
why autocratic leadership almost always 
falters in a larger, more complex economy. 
Under autocratic leadership, a major risk 
is the allocation of economic assets (capital 
and people), which are, over time, used to 
further political interests, leading to ineffi-
cient companies and markets, favoritism and 
corruption. In addition, autocratic leadership 
diminishes the rule of law and transparency 
– damaging the ability to create a well- 
functioning financial system (this certainly 
restricts the internationalizing of the RMB).
Disruption of trade is another risk China 
faces. The United States’ trade issues with 
China are substantial and real. They include 
the theft or forced transfer of intellec-
tual property; lack of bilateral investment 
rights, transfer of ownership or control of 
investments; onerous non-tariff barriers; 
unfair subsidies or benefits for state-owned 
enterprises; and the lack of rapid enforce-
ment of any disagreements. Our position 
is supported, though, in an uncoordinated 
way, by our Japanese and European allies. 
We should expect China to do only what is 
in its own self-interest. Near term, we expect 
challenge and conflict to characterize the 
relationship between China and the West 
over a range of economic, human rights and 
strategic issues. There may, however, be areas 
65
VI. PUBLIC POLICY  
AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM, COMPETITIVENESS AND LEADERSHIP: CHALLENGED BY CHINA, COVID-19 AND OUR OWN COMPETENCE
where we will simply never agree. As the two 
largest economies in the world, China and 
the United States should continue to have 
a long-term interest in collaborating where 
we can on critical global issues, including 
climate change, global health and stability on 
the Korean Peninsula. This will not be easy, 
but we will need to mature the management 
of this relationship so we can deal head on 
with our differences while continuing to seek 
common ground on our common challenges. 
China does not have a straight road to 
becoming the dominant economic power. 
To put this in perspective, America’s GDP 
per person in 2019 was $65,000 and China’s 
was $10,000. Even if we do a rather poor 
job at managing our economy (growing at 
2%), our GDP per person in 20 years would 
be $85,000. And if the Chinese do a good 
job managing their economy, their GDP per 
person in 2040 would still be under $35,000. 
While China is well on its way to becoming 
a fully developed nation, it may face more 
uncertainty and moments of slower growth 
in the future (like the rest of us) than in 
the past. For the near term, if China and 
the United States can maintain a healthy 
strategic and economic relationship, it could 
greatly benefit both countries – as well as the 
rest of the world. 
America is in a very strong position.
We have the resources to emerge from this 
latest economic crisis as a stronger country. 
Sometimes we forget how blessed we already 
are. America is still the most prosperous 
nation the world has ever seen. We are 
blessed with the natural gifts of land; all the 
food, water and energy we need; the Atlantic 
and Pacific oceans as natural borders; and 
wonderful neighbors in Canada and Mexico. 
And we are blessed with the extraordinary 
gifts from our Founding Fathers, which are 
still unequaled: freedom of speech, freedom 
of religion, freedom of enterprise, the sanc-
tity of the individual, and the promise of 
equality and opportunity for all. These gifts 
have led to a bold and dynamic economy – 
one that nurtures vibrant businesses large 
and small, exceptional universities and a 
welcoming environment for innovation, 
science and technology. America was an idea 
borne on principles, not based upon histor-
ical relationships and tribal politics. It has 
and will continue to be a beacon of hope for 
the world and a magnet for the world’s best 
and brightest.
America has strong and deep economic and 
geopolitical relationships with a large part of 
the world – mainly, but not exclusively, with 
our allies, including Canada and Mexico, 
countries of the European Union, Great 
Britain, Japan, South Korea and Australia, to 
name a few. With these allies, we respect the 
values of democracy, individual rights and 
economic freedoms. Collectively, we need to 
reassert our foundational strengths, which 
are grounded in our common principles, 
mutual trust and cooperation, and shared 
prosperity. As a nation, America needs to 
reassert its confidence in democracy and 
re-establish that it can function competently 
in the interest of our people. Fundamentally, 
we need not fear the success of China; we 
need to fear only our own failure because 
that is the only thing that will truly limit us.
America should engage and exercise its 
power and influence – cautiously, judiciously 
and respectfully – with various international 
organizations (the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization, the United Nations and the 
World Trade Organization). While there are 
many legitimate complaints about these 
organizations, the world is better off with 
these institutions. Americans should under-
stand that global laws, standards and norms 
will be established whether or not we partic-
ipate in setting them. However, it is certain 
that we will be happier with the evolution of 
global standards around trade, immigration, 
corporate governance and other important 
issues if we help craft and implement them. 
We should not abdicate this role – if we do, 
that void will simply be filled by China and 
66
VI. PUBLIC POLICY   
AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM, COMPETITIVENESS AND LEADERSHIP: CHALLENGED BY CHINA, COVID-19 AND OUR OWN COMPETENCE
others. Our engagement and leadership in 
the world are as important for our country as 
they are for the rest of the globe.
My fervent hope is that America will roll up 
its sleeves and bring bold leadership to our 
self-inflicted problems. Business and govern-
ment collaborating together can conquer 
our biggest challenges – income inequality, 
economic opportunity, education and health-
care for all, infrastructure, affordable housing 
and disaster preparedness, to name a few. 
We can be unabashed about the exception-
alism of America while acknowledging that 
we have problems. As we work together for 
an inclusive recovery that is long lasting, we 
must never forget that America’s economic 
prosperity is a necessary foundation for 
our military capability, which keeps us free 
and strong and is essential to world peace. 
America is still the arsenal of democracy. 
While I have a deep and abiding faith in the 
United States of America and its extraordi-
nary resiliency and capabilities, we do not 
have a divine right to success. Our chal-
lenges are significant, and we should not 
assume they will take care of themselves. 
Let us all do what we can to strengthen our 
exceptional union.

peer rankings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds and at the primary share class 
level or fund level for all other funds. Primary share class, as defined by Morningstar, denotes 
the share class recommended as being the best proxy for the portfolio and, in most cases, will 
be the most retail version (based upon annual management charge, minimum investment, 
currency and other factors). Where peer group rankings given for a fund are in more than one 
primary share class territory, both rankings are included to reflect local market competitiveness.

funds. A 4-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 3-star rating 
represents the next 35% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents the next 
22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating and represents the 
bottom 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. The overall Morningstar rating is derived from a 
weighted average of performance figures associated with a fund’s three-, five- and 10-year (if 
applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.-domiciled funds, separate star ratings are given 
at the individual share class level. The Nomura star rating is based on three-year risk-adjusted 
performance only. Funds with fewer than three years of history are not rated and hence 
excluded from this analysis. All ratings and the assigned peer categories used to derive this

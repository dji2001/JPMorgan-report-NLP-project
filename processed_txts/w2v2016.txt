dear fellow shareholders i begin this letter with a sense of gratitude and pride about jpmorganchase that has only grown stronger over the course of the last decadeours is an exceptional company with an extraordinary heritage and a promising futurethroughout a period of profound political and economic change around the world our company has been steadfast in our dedication to the clients communities and countries we serve while earning a fair return for our shareholders  was another breakthrough year for our companywe earned a record  billion in net income on revenue  of  billion reflecting strong underlying performance across our businesseswe have delivered record results in six out of the last seven years and we hope to continue to deliver in the futureour stock price is a measure of the progress we have made over the yearsthis progress is a function of continually making important investments in good times and not so good times to build our capabilities — people

                                                 the extraordinarily difficult legal regulatory and political environments that followedwe have long contended that these factors explained why bank stock priceearnings ratios were appropriately depressedand we believe the anticipated reversal of many negatives and the expectation of a more businessfriendly environment coupled with our sustained strong business results are among the reasons our stock price has done so well this past yearas you know we believe tangible book value per share is a good measure of the value we have created for our shareholdersif we believe our asset and liability values are appropriate — and we do — and if we believe we can continue to deploy this capital at an approximate  return on tangible equity which we do then our company should ultimately be worth considerably more than tangible book valueif you look at the chart below you’ll see that tangible book value “anchors” the stock pricein the last five years we have bought back  billion in stockin prior years i have explained why buying back our stock at tangible book value per share was a no brainerwhile the first and most important use of capital is to invest in growth buying back stock should also be considered when you are generating excess capitalwe do tangible book value and average stock price per share –              tangible book value

per share and tangible book value per share substantially higher than they otherwise would have been just four years laterwhile we prefer buying our stock at tangible book value we think it makes sense to do so at or around two times tangible book value for reasons similar to those we’ve expressed in the pastif we buy back a big block of stock this year using analyst earnings estimates for the next five years we would expect earnings per share in five years to be — higher and tangible book value would be virtually unchangedin this letter i discuss the issues highlighted on the next page — which describe many of our successes and opportunities as well as our challenges and responseslike last year’s letter we have organized much of the content around some of the key questions we have

organic growth in our companywe have confidence in the underlying growth in the us and global economies which will fuel the growth in our customer base – consumer deposits assets under management and small to large clients globallythis growth will obviously be faster in emerging markets than in devel oped markets – and we are wellpositioned to serve bothin addition we believe we can continue to gain share in many markets and over time add new relevant productsthis can drive organic growth for yearscapturing this growth is very basic • selectively adding investment bankers and private bankers around the world • bringing consumer and commercial banking branches and capabilities to more places in the united states • adding wholesale branches overseas and carefully expanding into new countries • adding wholesale and private bank clients as they grow into our target space equally important is using technology and fintech to do a better job serving clients and to grow our businesses – with better products and servicesyou can read more about our big data machine learning payment systems cybersecurity and electronic trading on pages – described by our senior executivesbut i do want to highlight a few items in the next question that pertain to these topicswhat are some technology and fintech initiatives that you’re most excited about one of the reasons we’re performing well as a company is we never stopped investing in technology – this should never changein  we spent more than  billion in technology firmwide of which approxi mately  billion is dedicated toward new initiativesof that amount approximately  million is spent on emerging fintech solutions – which include building and improving digital and mobile services and partnering with fintech companiesthe reasons we invest so much in technology whether it’s digital big data or machine learning are simple to benefit customers with better faster and often cheaper prod ucts and services to reduce errors and to make the firm more efficientwe are developing great new productswe are currently developing some exciting new products and services which we will be adding to our suite and rolling out later this year including • endtoend digital banking – the ability to open an account and complete the majority of transactions on a mobile phone • investment advice and selfdirected investing – online vehicles for both indi vidual retirement and nonretirement accounts providing easytouse and inexpensive automated advice as well as enabling our customers to buy and sell stocks and bonds etc again inexpensively • electronic trading and other online services eg cash management in our corporate  investment bank and asset  wealth management businesses – offering our clients a more robust digital platform   ithe jpmorganchase franchise we are investing in data and technology to improve the financial health of lowincome householdsover the last two years the jpmorganchase institute has helped identify some of the most pressing financial challenges facing american households such as their difficulty managing income and expense volatilitywe are using that data to select and support innovative fintech companies and nonprofits that are designing solutions to address these challengesone example of these efforts is jpmorganchase’s financial solutions lab which in partnership with the center for financial services innovation seeks to facilitate the next generation of fintech prod ucts to help consumers manage their daily finances and meet their longterm goalshighlights of the initiative include • to date the lab has helped support more than  fintech companies working to improve the financial health of more than  million americansone example is digit an automated savings tool that identi fies small amounts of money that can be moved into savings based on spending and incometo date it has helped ameri cans save more than  million • lab winners have raised more than  million in followon capital • in  we launched a new competition seeking innovative fintech solutions to promote the financial health of popula tions often overlooked such as people of color individuals with disabilities and low income womenwe are successfully collaborating with other companies to deliver fintech solutionswhether it is consumer payment systems zelle mortgages roostify auto finance truecar small business lending ondeck capital or communications systems symphony we are successfully collabo rating with some excellent fintech companies to dramatically improve our digital and other customer offeringsi’d like to highlight just two new exciting areas • developer services api store – by providing direct interfaces with our appli cations fully controlled of course we are enabling entrepreneurs partners fintech companies and clients to build new prod ucts or services dedicated to specific needs • bill payment and business services – while i can’t reveal much at the moment suffice it to say there are some interesting developments coming as we integrate our capabilities with those of other companieshow do we protect customers and their sensitive information while enabling them to share data for years we have been describing the risks – to banks and customers – that arise when customers freely give away their bank pass codes to thirdparty services allowing virtu ally unlimited access to their datacustomers often do not know the liability this may create for them if their passcode is misused and in many cases they do not realize how their data are being usedfor example access to the data may continue for years after customers have stopped using the thirdparty serviceswe recently completed a new arrangement with intuit which we think represents an important step forwardin addition to protecting the bank the customers and even the third party in this case intuit it allows customers to share data – how and when they wantunder this arrangement customers can choose whatever they would like to share and opting to turn these selec tions on or off as they see fitthe data will be “pushed” to intuit eliminating the need for sharing bank passcodes which protects the bank and our customers and reduces potential liabilities on intuit’s part as wellwe are hoping this sets a new standard for datasharing relationships  ithe jpmorganchase franchisewhat are your biggest geopolitical risks banks have to manage a lot of risks – from credit and trading risks to technological operational conduct and cybersecurity risksbut in addition to those we have exposures around the world which are subject to normal cyclical and recession risks as well as to complex geopolitical risksthere are always geopolitical risks and you can rest assured we are continuously reviewing analyzing and stress testing them to ensure that our company can endure themwe always try to make certain that we can handle the worst of all cases – importantly without disrupting the effective operation of the company and its service to our clientswe think these geopolitical risks currently are in a heightened state – that is beyond what we might consider normalthere are two specific risks i want to point out brexit and the increasing risk to the european union euregarding brexit a key concern is to make sure our company is prepared to support our clients on day one – the first day after the actual brexit occurs approximately two years from nowwe are confident we will be able to develop and expand the capabilities that our eu subsidiaries and branches will need to serve our clients properly in europe under eu lawthis will require acquiring regulatory approvals transferring certain technologies and moving some peopleon day one we need to perform all of our critical functions at our standardsfor example underwriting debt and equity moving money and accepting deposits and safeguarding the custody assets for all of our european clients including many sovereigns themselveswe must be prepared to do this assuming a hard exit by the united kingdom – it would be irrespon sible to presume otherwisewhile this does not entail moving many people in the next two years we do suspect that following brexit there will be constant pressure by the eu not to “outsource” services to the united kingdom but to continue to move people and capabili ties into eu subsidiarieswe hope that the advent of brexit would lead the eu to focus on fixing its issues – immi gration bureaucracy the ongoing loss of sovereign rights and labor inflexibility – and thereby pulling the eu and the monetary union closer togetherour fear however is that it could instead result in political unrest that would force the eu to split apartthe unraveling of the eu and the monetary union could have devastating economic and political effectswhile we are not predicting this will happen the probabilities have certainly gone up – and we will keep a close eye on the situa tion in europe over the next several yearsdeglobalization mexico and chinaantiglobalization sentiment is growing in parts of the world today usually expressing itself in antitrade and antiimmigration posi tions i’m not going to write about immigra tion in this letter – we have always supported proper immigration – it is a vital part of the strength of america and properly done it enhances the economy and the vitality of the country we do not believe globalization will reverse course – we believe trade has been absolutely critical for growth around the world and has benefited billions of peoplewhile there are some issues with our trade policies that need to be fixed poorly conceived antitrade policies could be quite disruptive particularly with two of our key trading partners mexico and chinathe trade deal with mexico through nafta is simpler than the one with china in full disclosure jpmorganchase is a major inter national bank in mexico with revenue of more than  million serving mexican american and international clients who do business there mexico is a longstanding peaceful neighbor and it is wholly in our country’s interest that mexico be a pros perous nationthis actually reduces immi gration issues there are now more mexicans   ithe jpmorganchase franchise going back to mexico than coming into the united statesour trade agreement with mexico helps ensure that the young democ racy in mexico is not hijacked by populist and antiamerican leaders like chavez did in venezuelawhile there are some clear identifiable problems with nafta i believe they will be worked out in a way that is fair and beneficial for both sidesthe logic to do so is completely compellingchina is far more complex again in full disclosure we have a major international presence in china with revenue of approxi mately  million serving chinese american and international clients who do business in that country the united states has some serious trade issues with china which have grown over the years – from cybersecurity and the protection of intel lectual property to tariffs nontariff trade barriers and nonfulfillment of world trade organization obligationshowever there is no inevitable or compelling reason that china and america have to clash – in fact improving political and economic relation ships can be good for both partiesso while the issues here are not easy i am hopeful they can be resolved in a way that is fair and constructive for the two countriesalthough banks and other large companies remain unpopular with some people you often say how proud you are of jpmorganchasewhy i firmly believe the qualities embedded in jpmorganchase today – the knowledge and cohesiveness of our people our deep client relationships our technology our strategic thinking and our global presence – cannot be replicatedwhile we take nothing for granted as long as we continue to do our jobs well and continue to drive our company forward we think we can be a leader for our industry and the communities we serve for decades to comethere are times when i am bursting with pride with what we have accomplished for our clients communities and countries around the world – let me count some of the ways we are strong and steadfast and are there for our clients in good times and badin the toughest of times we maintained a healthy and vibrant company that was able to do its job – we did not need govern ment support and in fact we consistently provided credit and capital to our clients and assistance to our government throughout the crisisi want to remind our shareholders that we continued to lend not at the much higher prevailing market rates at that time but at existing bank ratesthese were far below market rates because our clients relied on us – we were their lender of last resortjpmorganchase was and will be a rock of gibraltar in the best and worst of times for our clients around the world   ithe jpmorganchase franchise we have extraordinary capabilities — both our people and our technologyultimately our people are our most impor tant assets – and they are exceptionaltheir knowledge their capabilities and their relationships are what drive everything else including our technology and our innovationthey partner well with each other around the world and they are deeply trusted by our clients and within our communitieswe all owe them an enormous debtthey are the ones accomplishing all the things you are reading about in this annual reportour fortress balance sheet and the strength of our people were never more vividly evident than during the darkest hours of the financial crisisi was in awe of the tremen dous effort our people made thousands of people seven days a week for months new and renewed credit and capital for our clients at december  small business                   card  auto          commercialmiddle market          asset management          mortgagehome equity          corporate

thereby saving  jobs and avoiding the devastation of commu nities that would have happened if those companies had been allowed to failour company went above and beyond the call of duty during the height of the crisis including lending  billion to a bankrupt lehman to facilitate as much as possible an orderly unwind of its assetsin those dark days we were the only bank willing to commit to lending  billion to the state of california  billion to the state of new jersey and  billion to the state of illinois to keep those states strongnone of these actions had to be taken and they were made at some risk to jpmorganchasewe simply were acting to do our part to try to stop the crisis from getting worsewe try to be outstanding corporate citizenswe believe in being great corporate citizens – in how we treat our employees and care for our clients and communitieslet me give some examples to illustrate this point • we compensate our employees fairly and provide extraordinary benefits and trainingwe value our employees at jpmorganchase and we are committed to helping them succeedthis past year we announced that we will increase our minimum wages – mostly for entrylevel bank tellers and customer service repre sentatives – to between  and  an hour depending on where these employees livethis will increase wages for approximately  employeeswe believe this pay increase is the right thing to do and above all it enables more people to begin to share in the rewards assets entrusted to us by our clients at december   in billions  represents assets under management as well as custody brokerage administration and deposit accounts  represents activities associated with the safekeeping and servicing of assetsclient assets wholesale deposits consumer deposits deposits

will also continue to invest in employee benefits and training opportu nities so that our workers can continue to increase their skills and advance their careersour comprehensive benefits package including healthcare and retire ment savings on average is valued at  per yearour total investment in training and development is approximately  million a yeartogether these efforts help our employees support their fami lies advance their careers and promote economic growth in our communities • we have a diverse workforcewe have more than  employees globally with over  in the united stateswomen represent  of our employeesrecently oliver wyman a leading global manage ment consulting firm issued a report stating that it would be  years before women reach  executive committee representation within global financial servicesso you might be surprised to find out that women already represent  of my direct reports and approximately  of our company’s senior leadership globallythey run major businesses – several units on their own would be among fortune  companiesin addition to having three women on our operating committee – who run asset  wealth management finance and legal – some of our other busi nesses and functions headed by women include consumer banking credit card usprivate bank usmergers  acquisi tions global equity capital markets global research regulatory affairs global philanthropy our us branch network our controller and firmwide marketingi believe we have some of the best women leaders in the corporate world globallyin addition to gender diversity  of our firm’s population is ethnically diverse in the united states and we are in more than  countries around the worlddiversity means running a company where people are respected trusted and given equal opportunity to contribute and raise their ideas and voicesbut there is one area in particular where we simply have not met the standards jpmorganchase has set for itself – and that is in increasing africanamerican talent at the firmwhile we think our effort to attract and retain black talent is as good as at most other companies it simply is not good enoughtherefore in  we introduced a new firmwide initiative called advancing black leadersthis initiative is dedicated to helping us better attract and recruit external black talent while retaining and developing the talent within the companyand we are proud of our efforts this past year – we increased the number of black employees at the officer level through both internal promotions and external new hires we focused on the pipeline of junior talent and we increased the number at the senior officer and vice president levelwe plan to continue to make progress on this front in the years to come • we are proud of how we are helping veteranswe want to continue to update you on how jpmorganchase has helped position military members veterans and their familiesour program is centered on facilitating success in their postservice lives primarily through employment and retentionin  jpmorganchase and  other companies launched the  jobs mission setting a goal of collectively hiring  veteransthe initiative now includes more than  companies has collectively hired nearly  veterans and is focused on collectively hiring  million peoplejpmorganchase alone has hired more than  veterans sincewe hope you feel as good about this initiative as we do • we have accomplished an extraordinary amount in our corporate responsibility effortswe take this responsibility very seriously and over the last decade not only have we more than doubled our philanthropic giving from approximately   ithe jpmorganchase franchise  million to approximately  million in  but we have dramati cally increased our support with human capital collaboration data and manage ment expertiseour head of corporate responsibility talks about our significant measures in more detail in his letter but i will highlight two initiatives below − we provide tremendous support to cities and communities – espe cially those left behind – and the best example is our work in detroitjpmorganchase has been doing busi ness in detroit for more than  years and we watched as this iconic american city was engulfed in economic turmoil after years of declinejust as detroit was declaring bankruptcy our company redoubled its efforts to help and in  announced our most comprehen sive initiative to date – a  million investment in detroit to help accelerate the city’s recoverywe are making strategic coordinated investments focused on creating economically inclusive and revital ized neighborhoods preparing people with the skills needed for today’s highquality jobs and providing small businesses with the capital they need to grow and succeedthis includes our investment in the strategic neighbor hoods fund which brings together community developers and dedicated resources to create and maintain afford able housing and deliver services to targeted communitieswe also seeded the city’s first nonprofit real estate development firm focused exclusively on creating and preserving affordable housing in detroit’s neighborhoodsin  we helped create the  million entrepreneurs of color fund with the kellogg foundation and detroit devel opment fund to bring critical financing and technical assistance to underserved minority and communitybased small businessesin its first year the fund deployed almost  million in capital through more than  loanswe are also putting our talented employees to work in detroit through the detroit service corpssince   jpmorganchase employees from  countries dedicated three intensive weeks to  detroit nonprofits helping them analyze challenges solve problems and improve their chances for successdetroit is making incredible progress as a result of the unprecedented spirit of engagement and cooperation among the city’s leaders business commu nity and nonprofit sectorsjpmorganchase is proud to be part of detroit’s resurgence and we believe a thriving detroit economy will become a shining example of american resilience and ingenuity at work − and more broadly we created solutions for one of our country’s biggest chal lenges – training the world’s work force in the skills needed to compete in today’s economythrough several targeted initiatives jpmorganchase is investing over  million in demand driven workforce development initia tives around the worldour programs build stronger labor markets that create economic opportunity focusing on middleskill jobs – positions that require a high school education and often specialized training or certifica tions but not a college degreethese jobs – surgical technologists diesel mechanics help desk technicians and more – offer good wages and the chance to move up the economic ladderour goal is to increase the number of workers who have access to career path ways whether they are adults looking to develop new skills or younger workers starting to prepare for careers during high school and ending with postsecondary degrees or credentials aligned with goodpaying highdemand jobswe are very proud that we can be a bridge between businesses and job seekers to support an economy that creates opportunity for everyone   iiwe had a severe financial crisis followed by needed reform and our financial system is now stronger and more resilient as a resultduring and since the crisis we’ve always supported thoughtful effective regulation not simply more or lessbut it is an understatement to say improvements could be madethe regulatory environ ment is unnecessarily complex costly and sometimes confusingno rational person could think that everything that was done was good fair sensible and effective or coherent and consistent in creating a safer and stronger systemwe believe and many studies show that poorly conceived and uncoordinated regulations have damaged our economy inhibiting growth and jobs – and this has hurt the average americanwe are not looking to throw out the entirety of doddfrank or other rules many of which were not specifically prescribed in dodd frankit is however appropriate to open up the rulebook in the light of day and rework the rules and regulations that don’t work well or are unnecessaryrest assured we will be responsibly and reasonably engaged on this frontwe believe changes can and should be made that preserve the safety and soundness of the financial system and lead to a more healthy and vibrant economy for the benefit of allthere are some basic principles that should guide responsible regulation • coherence of rules to be coordinated both within and across regulatory agencies • global harmonization of regulation to enhance fair trade and competition while helping eliminate any weak links in the global system • simplified and proper riskbased capital standards • consistent and transparent capital and liquidity rules • regular and rigorous regulatory review including consideration of costs vs bene fits efficiencies competitiveness reduc tion of redundant costs and assessment of impact on economic growth adhering to these principles will maximize safety and soundness increase competition and improve economic healthsince the financial crisis thousands of new rules and regulations have been put into place by multiple regulators in the united states and around the worldan already complex system of financial oversight and supervision has grown even more complex – and this complexity can sometimes create even more riskmany of these rules and regulations should be examined and possibly modified but i will focus on the few that are critical in response to some of the questions and topics that followregulatory reform   iiregulatory reformtalk about the strength and safety of the financial system and whether too big to fail has been solvedthere is no question that the system is safer and stronger today and this is mostly due to the following factors • dramatically higher capital for almost all banks we’ll talk later about how much capital is the appropriate amount • far higher liquidity for almost all banks again we’ll provide more details later in this section • more disclosure and transparency – both to investors and regulators • more coordinated oversight within the united states and abroad • far stronger compliance and control systems • laws that allow regulators to step in to unwind not only failing banks but invest ment banks this did not exist for invest ment banks prior to the financial crisis • the creation of “bailinable” unsecured debt – this converts debt into equity at the time of failure immediately recapitalizing the failed bank • new rules that prohibit derivatives contracts from being voided at bankruptcy – this allows derivatives contracts to stay in place creating an orderly transition to bankruptcy • stress testing that monitors banks’ balance sheets and capital ratios under severely adverse scenarios more on this below • requirements for banks and investment banks to prepare corporate recovery plans in the event of a crisis to prevent bank ruptcy these plans did not exist before the financial crisis these changes taken together not only largely eliminate the chance of a major bank failing today but also prevent such failure from having a threatening domino effect on other banks and the economy as a wholeand if a major bank does fail regula tors have the necessary tools to manage it in an orderly waymoreover the banking industry itself has an inherent interest in the safety and soundness of the financial system because if there is a failure the entire industry will be liable for that cost more on that belowessentially too big to fail has been solved — taxpayers will not pay if a bank failsthe american public has the right to demand that if a major bank fails they as taxpayers would not have to pay for it and the failure wouldn’t unduly harm the us economyin my view these demands have now both been meton the first count if a bank fails taxpayers do not payshareholders and debtholders now due to total loss absorbing capacity tlac rules are at risk for all lossesto add belts and suspenders if all that capital is not enough the next and final line of defense is the industry itself which is legally liable to pay any excess losses notably since o jpmorganchase alone has contributed  billion to the industry deposit fund on the second count a regulatory takeover of a major bank would be orderly because regulators have the tools to manage it in the right wayit is instructive to look at what would happen if lehman were to fail in today’s regulatory regimefirst of all it is highly unlikely the firm would fail because the new requirements would mean that instead of lehman’s equity capital being  billion which it was in  it would be approxi mately  billion under today’s capital rulesin addition lehman would have far stronger   iiregulatory reform liquidity and “bailinable” debtand finally the firm would be forced to raise capital much earlier in the processif lehman failed anyway regulators would now have the legal authority to put the firm in receivership they did not have that ability back in –the moment that happened unsecured debt of approximately  billion would be immediately converted to equityderivatives contracts would not be triggered and cash would continue to move through the pipes of the financial systemin other words due to the living wills too big to fail was solved before any additional rules were put in place i’m not going to go into detail on the living wills but will say that while they have some positive elements they have become unnecessarily complex and costly and they need to be simplified last there is a new push for chapter  bankruptcy for banks which we at jpmorganchase supportthis would provide specialized rules to quickly handle bankruptcy for bankswhether a failed bank goes through chapter  called “bankruptcy” or title ii called “resolution” – these are essentially the same thing – we should make the following point perfectly clear to the american people a failed bank means the bank’s board and management are discharged its equity is worthless compensation is clawed back to the extent of the law and the bank’s name will forever be buried in the hall of shamein addition we should change the term “reso lution” – as it sounds as if we are bailing out a failing bank which couldn’t be further from the truthwhatever the term is called it should be made clear that the process is the same as bankruptcy in any other industryone lesson from the prior crisis is that the american public will not be satisfied without “old testament justice” but market panic will never disappear entirely and regulations must be flexible enough to allow banks to act as a bulwark against it rather than forcing financial institutions into a defensive crouch that will only make things worsethere will be market panic again and it won’t affect just banks – it will affect the entire financial marketplaceremember banks were consistent providers of credit at existing prices into the crisis – the market was notduring the crisis many companies could not raise money in the public markets many securities did not trade securities issu ances dropped dramatically and many asset prices fell to valuation levels that virtually anticipated a great depressionlast time around banks – in particular and i say with pride our bank – stood by their customers to provide capital and liquidity that helped them survivehowever today’s capital and liquidity rules have created rigidity that will actually hurt banks’ ability to stand against the tide as they did during the great reces sionthis will mean that banks will survive the next market panic with plenty of cushion that could have been – but may not have been – used to help customers companies and communitiesit is in this environment that regulators need certain authorities to stop the situation from getting worseone important point under both chapter  and title ii there might be a shortterm need for the federal deposit insurance corporation or the fed to lend money in the short run with proper collat eral to a failing or failed institutionthis is because panic can cause a run on the bank and it is far less painful to the economy if that bank’s assets are not sold in fire salesthis lending is effectively fully secured and no loss should ever be incurredagain any loss that did occur would be charged back to all the banksthis also gives banks an enor mous incentive to be in favor of a properly designed safe and sound systemgoing back to the principles above putting safety and soundness first is clearly correct but regulators also need the ability to take into consideration the costs and impact on our economy in various scenarios   iiregulatory reformhow and why should capital rules be changed we need consistent transparent simplified and more riskbased capital standardsa healthy banking system needs consistent and transparent capital and liquidity rules that are based on simplified and proper riskbased standardsthis allows banks to use capital intelligently and to properly plan capital levels over the yearsany rules that are capricious or that cause an arbitrary reduction in the value of a bank’s capital – and the value of the bank overall – can cause improper or inefficient risk takingfinally proper capital rules will allow a bank to do its job to consistently finance the economy in good times and importantly in bad timesthere are more than  different major capital and liquidity requirements – and they often are inconsistentfor example certain liquidity rules force a bank to hold an increasing amount of cash essentially deposited at the fed but other rules require the bank to hold capital against this riskfree cashan extraordinary number of calcula tions need to be made as companies try to manage to avoid inadvertently violating one of the standards – a violation that rarely affects safety and soundnessto protect themselves banks build enormous buffers – and buffers on top of buffers – or otherwise take unnecessary actions to ensure that they don’t step over the lineand finally if we our fortress balance sheet at december    cet

on page  shows the dramatic improvement in our capital and liquidity numbers sinceremember we had enough capital and liquidity in  to easily handle the crisis that ensuedthe numbers are even better than they look on the chart for the following reasons • in  there was no such thing as operational risk capital not to say there wasn’t operational risk but just that capital was not applied to itif you measured our capital ratio on the same basis as in  that is on an apples to apples basis we wouldn’t have just  today vs  in  – we would have  today vs  in  • since  the regulatory definition of liquidity has been prescribednow only deposits at a central bank treasuries and governmentguaranteed mortgagebacked securities plus a limited amount of sovereign and corporate bonds count as liquiditymany securities are not allowed to count as liquidity today – on the theory that they can sustain losses and occasion ally become illiquidwhile maybe not all  of the current value of these securi ties should apply toward liquidity require ments they should count for somethingif you did combine all of these categories as liquidity our liquidity at jpmorganchase would have gone from  billion in  to  billion todayand remember our deposits – theoretically subject to “run on the bank” risk – total  trillioneven in the great recession the worst case for a bank was only a  loss of its deposits • finally when you include longterm debt and preferred stock as loss absorbing capital our total capital is approximately  billion vs true riskweighted assets of  trillion essentially since  our total capital has gone from  billion to  billion while actual riskweighted assets have declined to  trillionin addition to our fortress balance sheet we are welldiversified and we have healthy margins and strong controlsthese are all factors that dramatically improve safety and soundness but they are not included in any measuresas you will see below we can handle almost any stresswe believe in stress testing but it could be improved and simplifiedas you know the fed puts our company through one “severely adverse” stress test annually which determines how we can use our capital pay dividends buy back stock and expandwe are great believers in stress testing but would like to make the following points • our shareholders should know that we don’t rely on one stress test a year – we conduct more than  each week across all of our riskiest exposureswe meet weekly we analyze each exposure in multiple ways we are extremely risk conscious • the federal reserve’s comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar stress test estimates what our losses would be through a severely adverse event lasting over nine quarters which approximates the severity and time of the great recession eg high unem ployment counterparty failures etcthe fed estimates that in such a scenario we would lose  billion over the ensuing nine quarters which is easily manageable by jpmorganchase’s capital basemy own view is that we would make money in almost every quarter in that type of environment and this is supported by our having earned approximately  billion pretax over the course of the nine quarters during the real financial crisis   iiregulatory reform we don’t completely understand the fed’s assumptions and models – the fed does not share them with us we hope there will be more transparency and clarity in the futurebut we do understand that the fed’s stress test shows results far worse than our own test because the fed’s stress test is not a fore cast of what you actually think will happeninstead it appropriately makes additional assumptions about a company’s likelihood to fail – that its trading losses will be far worse than expected etcthe fed wants to make sure the bank has enough capital if just about everything goes wrongfinally while we firmly believe banks should have a proper assessment of their qualitative abilities this should not be part of a oncea year stress testinstead it should be part of the fed’s regular exam processthe fed and the banks should work together to continu ously improve the quality of their processes while creating a consistent safe and econ omygrowing use of capitalit is clear that the banks have too much capitalhere is another critical point the fed’s stress test of the  major banks estimates what each bank would lose assuming it were the worst bank in the crisis which of course will not be true in the real worldbut even if that happened the chart below shows that if you combine all the banks’ extreme losses the total losses add up to less than  of the banks’ combined capitalthis definitively proves that there is excess capital in the systemand more of that capital can be safely used to finance the economyproper calibration of capital is critical to ensure not only that the system is safe and sound but that banks can use their capital to finance the economyand we think it’s clear that banks can use more of their capital to finance the economy without sacrificing safety and soundnesshad they been less afraid of potential ccar stress losses banks probably would have been more aggressive in making some

large addonif you are going to have operational risk capital it should be forward looking fairly calculated coordinated with other capital rules and consistent with reality currently if you exit a business that created operational risk capital you are still most likely required to hold the operational risk capital finally america should eliminate its “gold plating” of international standardsamerican regulators took the new basel standards across a wide variety of calcula tions and asked for moreif jpmorganchase could use the same international standards as other international banks it would free up a material amount of capitalthe removal of the gsib surcharge “gold plating” alone would free up  billion of equity capital – an amount that could support almost  billion of

many of these regulatory standards could help finance the growth of the american economy without damaging the safety and soundness of the systemhow do certain regulatory policies impact money markets

activities and we believe this has caused distortions in the marketplacefor example matchfunding ensures that the risk characteristics — eg interest rate maturity — of the asset eg loan are offset by the liability eg deposit funding it   iiregulatory reform • swap spreads for the first time in history turned negative which means that corpo rations need to pay a lot more to hedge their interest

any risk whatsoever we simply would have deposited the  billion at the central bankthe charts below shows some of the reduc tion in banks’ marketmaking abilitieswe need to work closely with regulators to assess the impact of the new rules on specific markets the cost and volatility of liquidity and the potential cost of creditwe should be able to make some modest changes that in no way impact safety and soundness but improve marketshow has regulation affected monetary policy the flow of bank credit and the growth of the economy it is extremely important that we analyze how new capital and liquidity rules affect the creation of credit ie lendingwe have yet to see thorough thoughtful analysis on this subject by economists – because in this case it is very hard to calculate what might have been counterfactualhowever it seems clear that if banks had been able to use more of their capital and liquidity they would have been more aggressive in terms of expanding think of additional bankers bank branches and geographies which likely would have led to additional lending on the following pages we make it clear that this would have been the case in mortgage lending i would like to focus on how liquidity policies may have impacted the effectiveness of mone tary policy and lendingthe chart on page  shows bank loans vs bank deposits from  toduring the last several decades deposits

not enough loan demand due to a slowgrowing economy • the new liquidity rules require banks to hold approximately  trillion at the federal reserve whether or not there is loan demandit is evident that banks reduced certain types of lending legitimately – think of some of the inappropriate subprime mortgage lending – but banks cut back on other types of lending as well because of the new rules for example small business lending due to ccar and crossborder lending because of gsibthe ensuing discussion shows how other regula tory rules dramatically decreased mortgage lending again slowing down the economyit is clear that the transmission of monetary policy is different today from what it was in the past because of new capital and liquidity ruleswhat is not clear is how much these rules

sector has been unusually slow to recover and that may be partly due to restric tions in mortgage creditseven major federal regulators and a long list of state and local regulators have overlapping jurisdiction on mortgage laws and wrote a plethora of new rules and regulations appro priately focused on educating and protecting customerswhile some of the rules are beneficial many were hastily developed and layered upon existing rules without coordina tion or calibration as to the potential effectsthe result is a complex highly risky and unpredictable operating environment that exposes lenders and servicers to dispropor tionate legal liability and materially increases operational risks and coststhese actions resulted in • mortgages that cost the consumer more • a tightening credit box ie mortgage lenders are less likely to extend credit to borrowers without a strong credit history • an inhibition of the return of private capital to the housing industry • the crowding out of

taxpayer dependent — we need to complete the securitization standardsprivate capital in the mortgage industry particularly in the form of securitizations dried up as a result of the financial crisiseight years later we still have not opened up a healthy securitization market because of our inability to finalize the rulesnot only does this reduce the share of private capital in the us housing sector an action that would significantly reduce taxpayer expo sure it also significantly increases the cost to the customertaking a few actions would fix this including • rationalize capital requirements on securi tizations to effectively transfer risk to the market while leaving “skin in the game” with the originator • reduce the complexity of data delivery requirements • clarify and define materiality standards associated with compliance with laws and regulations as well as underwriting stan dards to allow for reasonable protections from litigation and to enable standardized due diligence practicesif we do this right we believe the mortgage market could add more than  billion a year in new purchased loansif we take the actions mentioned above we believe that the cost to a customer would be  basis points lower and that mortgage underwriters would be willing to take more – but appropriate – risk on loans again this would be for firsttime young and lower income buyers

than  billion purchased mortgages annually our analysis deliberately excludes underwriting the subprime and alta mort gages that caused so many problems in the great recessionhad we been able to fix these issues five years ago ie three years after the crisis our analysis shows that conservatively more than  trillion in mort gage loans might have been madeif this is true it may explain why our

builtby any estimate this could have had a significant impact on the growth of jobs and gross domestic product gdpour economists think that  trillion of loans could have increased gdp in each of those five years byin the next section we will talk about how this is just one of the many things we did to damage our nation’s economy   iiregulatory reformhow can we reduce complexity and create a more coherent regulatory system we created a massively complex system in which multiple regulators have overlap ping responsibilities on virtually every issue including rulemaking examination auditing and enforcementthis is extremely taxing complex and overly burdensome for banks customers of banks and regulatorsdoddfrank appropriately established the financial services oversight committee fsoc and assigned to it the responsibility of general oversight across the entire finan cial systemunfortunately the fsoc was not given the ability to adjudicate issues or assign responsibilitytherefore the fsoc is unable to fully resolve some of the problems that we have detailed in this letterfinally another flaw is that some of the laws were written in a way that left them open to broad interpretation and novel enforcementthere is too much complexity in the system — it could be fixed and that would make the system strongernearly everyone agrees there is too much complexity in the current construct of the financial systema few examples will suffice • there are multiple calculations of capital living wills the volcker rule etc • there are multiple regulators involved independently in rulemaking – just two examples seven regulators are involved in setting mortgage regulations and five regulators oversee the volcker rulethis leads to slow rulemaking eg as noted above we still have not finished the mort gage rules eight years after the crisis excessive reporting and varied interpreta tions on what the actual rules are • each agency makes separate audit and reporting demands and can indepen dently take enforcement action on the same subjectthis is clearly a dysfunctional structurethe fix is simple – though getting it done may not be • the system should be simplifiedthere should be one primary regulator on any issue and we should always strive to make things as simple as possible • the primary regulator should establish the rules the reporting requirements the audit plans and the enforcement actionother regulators should get involved only if they believe the primary person did a particularly poor job • everything in the regulatory landscape should be reviewed in the context of safety and soundness costbenefit analysis and economic growththe fsoc is a good idea but needs to be modified to be more effectiveit makes sense for regulators to be continu ously reviewing the entire financial system in an effort to make it as safe and sound as possible think of this as a wellfunctioning risk committee of a major bankbut the fsoc should be given some authority to assign responsibility adjudicate disagree ments set deadlines and force the reso lution of critical issuesthe fsoc could also enforce due consideration of regula tions’ costs vs benefits and the impact on economic growthwe have great sympathy for and agree with the complaints of the community banksthey are struggling to deal with the complexity and cost of meeting these requirements – and we agree these smaller banks should be relieved of many of the requirementsenhancing the functionality of the fsoc and providing regulatory relief where appro priate should not be a political issuethe administration is currently conducting a review of the rules and regulations which are burdensome and duplicative and which may impede economic growththat process should be as depoliticized as possibleeveryone stands to gain when growth is enabled in a safe and sound manner   iiregulatory reformhow can we harmonize regulations across the globe currently american regulators have been pushing the basel committee – the interna tional forum that is supposed to set inter national financial regulatory guidelines – to meet the even higher american standards around capital requirements derivatives rules riskweight calculations stress testing and other requirementsmany other coun tries around the world are telling basel that it has gone too far and that it’s time to let the banks focus on healthy lending and growth of the economyfollowing are a few principles that we think should guide global regulations and international coordination to increase safety and soundness and foster global growth • international regulations should be coherent and generally harmonized around the world – but they don’t need to be exactly the same • we should recognize where there are legit imate reasons to do something differentfor example certain types of loans legiti mately could draw different risk weighting in various countries based on historical performance collateral and bankruptcy laws or even culture • crossborder financial rules need to be part of trade negotiations like any other product or servicewe know we will be increasingly competing with chinese banks and eventually we need the us government to make that part of our trade agreement • we can acknowledge that the state of affairs in different countries including in their banks and their economies may differ and that these differences might warrant idiosyncratic regulatory responsesfor example european banks for eight years have consistently been put in the position of having to raise more and more capital and liquidity or having to reduce their lending capacitywhile their capital standards may have been low compared with american standards particularly in how they calculate risk weighted assets this deleveraging has to have hurt the growth of european econo mies and opportunities for their peoplethese banks started from a different posi tion which had been sanctioned by both their regulators and governments years ago and we agree that these banks should be allowed to do their jobmost of these banks have plenty of total capitalwhile it might be true that one day they should have more the moral imperative now is to help their economies grow and to help the people of those countrieswe are completely convinced that if we can rationally change and coordinate many of these rules banks can do even more to help the economy thrive   before we address some of the critical issues confronting our country it would be good to count our blessingslet’s start with a serious assessment of our strengthsiiiamerica today is probably stronger than ever beforefor example • the united states has the world’s stron gest military and this will be the case for decadeswe are fortunate to be at peace with our neighbors and to have the protec tion of the atlantic and pacific oceans • as a nation we have essentially all the food water and energy we need • the united states has among the world’s best universities and hospitals • the united states has a generally reliable rule of law and low corruption • the government of the united states is the world’s longest surviving democracy which has been steadfast resilient and enduring through some very difficult times • the people of the united states have a great work ethic and cando attitude • americans are among the most entrepre neurial and innovative people in the world – from those who work on the factory public policybut it is clear that something is wrong — and it’s holding us backour economy has been growing much more slowly in the last decade or two than in the  years before thenfrom  to  real per capita gdp grew  from  to  it grewhad it grown at  instead of  in those  years our gdp per capita would be  or more than  per person higher than it isus productivity growth tells much the same story as shown in the chart on pageour nation’s lower growth has been accom panied by – and may be one of the reasons why – real median household incomes in  were actually  lower than they were inin addition the percentage of middle class households has actually shrunk over timein   of households were considered middle class but that percentage was only  inand for those in the bottom  of earners – mainly lower skilled workers – the story may be eventhe united states of america is truly an exceptional country floors to geniuses like the late steve jobsimproving “things” and increasing productivity are american pastimesand america still fosters an entrepreneurial culture which allows risk taking – and acknowledges that it can result in success or failure • the united states is home to many of the best most vibrant businesses on the planet – from small and midsized compa nies to large global multinationals • the united states has the widest deepest most transparent and best financial markets in the worldand i’m not talking about just wall street and banks – i include the whole mosaic venture capital private equity

the earnings distribution has declined by approx imately  since the early smany economists believe we are now permanently relegated to slower growth and lower productivity they say that secular stagnation is the new normal but i strongly disagreewe will describe in the rest of this section many factors that are rarely considered in economic models although they can have an enormous effect on growth and productivitymaking this list was an upsetting exercise especially since many of our problems have been selfinflictedthat said it was also a good reminder of how much of this is in our control and how critical it is that we focus on all the levers that could be pulled to help the us economywe must do this because it will help all americansmany other often noneconomic factors impact growth and productivityfollowing is a list of some noneconomic items that must have had a significant impact on america’s growth • over the last  years we have spent tril lions of dollars on wars when we could have been investing that money produc tively i’m not saying that money didn’t need to be spent but every dollar spent on battle is a dollar that can’t be put to use elsewhere • since  when the government took over student lending direct government lending to students has gone from approx imately  billion to more than  billion – creating dramatically increased student defaults and a population that is rightfully angry about how much money they owe particularly since it reduces their ability to get other creditsource haver bureau of labor statistics                  usproductivity growth year  change annualized   iiipublic policy • our nation’s healthcare costs are essen tially twice as much per person vs most other developed nations • it is alarming that approximately  this is an astounding  students each year of those who receive advanced degrees in science technology engi neering and math at american universi ties are foreign nationals with no legal way of staying here even when many would choose to do sowe are forcing great talent overseas by not allowing these young people to build their dreams here • felony convictions for even minor offenses have led in part to  million american citizens having a criminal record – and this means they often have a hard time getting a job there are six times more felons in the united states than in canada • the inability to reform mortgage markets has dramatically reduced mortgage avail abilitywe estimate that mortgages alone would have been more than  trillion higher had we had healthier mortgage marketsgreater mortgage access would have led to more homebuilding and addi tional jobs and investments which also would have driven additional growthany one of these noneconomic factors is fairly material in damaging america’s effort to achieve healthy growthlet’s dig a little bit deeper into six additional unsettling issues that have also limited our growth ratelabor force participation is too lowlabor force participation in the united states has gone from  to  between  and todaysome of the reasons for this decline are understandable and aren’t too worrisome – for example an aging popula tionbut if you examine the data more closely and focus just on labor force participation for one key segment ie men ages  you’ll see that we have a serious problemthe chart below shows that in america the participa tion rate for that cohort has gone from  in  to a little over  todaythis is way below labor force participation in almost every other developed nationlabor force participation rates for men ages – us

rate for this group went back to just  – the current average for the other developed nations – approxi mately  million more people would be working in the united statessome other highly disturbing facts include fiftyseven percent of these nonworking males are on disability and fully  of today’s youth ages – are ineligible for the military due to a lack of proper education basic reading or writing skills or health issues often obesity or diabeteseducation is leaving too many behindmany high schools and vocational schools do not provide the education our students need – the goal should be to graduate and get a decent jobwe should be ringing the national alarm bell that inner city schools are failing our children – often minorities and children from lower income householdsin many inner city schools fewer than  of students graduate and many of those who do graduate are not prepared for employ mentwe are creating generations of citizens who will never have a chance in this land

yearschina on the other hand has built  new civilian airports in the last  years aloneour corporate tax system is driving capital and brains overseasamerica now has the highest corporate tax rates among developed nationsmost other developed nations have reduced their tax rates substantially over the past  years and this is true whether looking at statu tory or effective tax ratesthis is causing considerable damageamerican corpora tions are generally better off investing their capital overseas where they can earn a higher return because of lower taxesin addition foreign companies are advantaged when they buy american companies – often they are able to reduce the overall tax rate of the combined companybecause of this american companies have been making substantial investments in human capital as well as in plants facilities research and development rd and acquisitions overseasalso american corporations hold more than  trillion in cash abroad to avoid the additional taxesthe only ques tion is how much damage will be done before we fix thisreducing corporate taxes would incent busi ness investment and job creationthe charts on page  show the following • that job growth is

actually depress wages in the united statesa  treasury depart ment review finds that labor “may bear a substantial portion of the burden from the corporate income tax” a study by kevin hassett from the american enterprise institute finds that each  increase in us corporate income tax collections leads to a  decrease in wages in the short run and a  decrease in aggregate wages in the long runand analysis of the us corporate income tax by the congressional budget office finds that labor bears more than  of the burden of the corporate income tax with the remaining  borne by domestic savers through a reduced return on their savingswe must fix this for the benefit of american competitive ness and all americansexcessive regulations reduce growth and business formationeveryone agrees we should have proper regu lation – and of course good regulations have many positive effectsbut anyone in business understands the damaging effects of over complicated and inefficient regulationsthere are many ways to look at regulations and the chart below and the two on page  provide some insightthe one below shows the total pages of federal regulations which is a simple way to illustrate additional reporting and compliance requirementsthe second records how we compare with the rest of the world on the ease of starting a new business – we used to be among the best and now we are notthe bottom chart on page  shows that small businesses now report that one of their largest problems is regulationsby some estimates approximately  tril lion is spent on regulations annually which is

one of the reasons why small business creation has slowed alarmingly in recent yearsaccording to the uschamber of commerce the rising burdens of federal regulations alone may be a main reason for a

respondents month average   iiipublic policy while some regulations quite clearly create a common good eg clean air and water it is clear that excessive regulation does not help productivity growth of the economy or job creationand even regulations that once may have made sense may no longer be fit for the purposei am not going to outline specific recommendations about nonfinancial regulatory reform here other than to say that we should have a perma nent and systematic review of the costs and benefits of regulations including their intended vs unintended consequencesthe lack of economic growth and opportunity has led to deep and understandable frustration among so many americanslow job growth a lack of opportunity for many declining wages students and low wage workers being left behind economic and job uncertainty high healthcare costs and growing income inequality all have created deep frustrationit is understand able why so many are angry at the leaders of america’s institutions including businesses schools and governments – they are right to expect us to do a better jobcollectively we are the ones responsibleadditionally this can understandably lead to disenchantment with trade globalization and even our free enterprise system which for so many people seems not to have workedour problems are significant and they are not the singular purview of either political partywe need coherent consistent compre hensive and coordinated policies that help fix these problemsthe solutions are not binary – they are not eitheror and they are not about democrats or republicansthey are about facts analysis ideas and best practices including what we can learn from others around the worldwe need to work together to improve work skillsi cannot in this letter tackle the complex set of issues confronting our inner city schools but i do know that if we don’t acknowledge these problems we will never fix themwhether they graduate from high school vocational or training school or go on to college our students can and should be adequately prepared for good decentpaying jobsand whether a student graduates from high school vocational school or training school the graduate should have a sense of pride and accomplishment – and meaningful employment opportunities without forgoing the chance to go to college later oncareer and technical education specifically can give young people the skills they need for decent paying roles in hundreds of fields including aviation robotics medical science welding accounting and coding – all jobs that are in demand todayin new york city not far from where i grew up in jackson heights queens there’s a school called aviation high schoolstudents travel from all over the city to go to the school with a  student attendance rate where they are trained in many facets of aviation from how to maintain an aircraft to the details of the plane’s electronics hydraulics and electrical systemsand when the students graduate  graduated in the normal four years they get a job often earning an annual starting salary of approximatelyit’s a great example of what we should be promoting in our educational systembusinesses must be involved in this processthey need to partner with schools to let them know what skills are needed help develop the appropriate curricula help train teachers and be prepared to hire the studentsin addition this has to be done locally because that is where the actual jobs aregermany does this wellgermany hashow can we start investing in our people to help them be more productive and share in the opportunities and rewards of our economy   iiipublic policy one of the strongest education and training systems in the world with about  million young people every year participating in apprenticeship programs that are paid oppor tunities to gain indemand skills along with an educationthe vocational schools and apprenticeship programs work directly with local businesses to ensure the students are connected to available jobs upon graduationas a result of this marketdriven vocational training germany’s youth unemployment rate is also one of the lowest in the worldthere is nothing wrong with learning from other countriesproper skills training also can be used to continuously reeducate american workersmany people are afraid that automation is taking away jobslet’s be cleartechnology is the best thing that ever happened to mankind and it is the reason the world is getting progressively betterbut we should acknowledge that though technology helps everyone generally it does cause some job loss dislocation and disruption in specific areasretraining is the best way to help those disrupted by advancements in technologywe need to help lower skilled workers earn a living wage while helping small businessesbusiness should support an expanded eitcthere is a tax credit in the united states called the earned income tax credit eitc which supplements lowpaid workers’ incomesfor example a single mother with two children earning  an hour approxi mately  a year could get a tax credit of more than  at the end of the yeara single man without children could get a tax credit under this program of only aboutthis program has flaws which we believe could be fixed but it has lifted an estimated  million people above the poverty line the federal poverty guideline is deter mined by household sizefor a fourperson household the poverty level is  or approximately  an hour last year the eitc program cost the united states about  billion and there were  million indi viduals who received the creditapproximately  million american workers earn between  an hour the prevailing federal minimum wage and  an hourapproximately  of amer ican workers make less than  an houri believe we should dramatically expand the eitc to help more lowpaid individuals with and without children earn a living wagei have no doubt that this will entice more workers back into the workforcejobs bring dignitythat first job is often the first rung on the ladderand studies show that once people start working they continue workingin addition living wages lead to less crime more household formation and it is hoped better social outcomes including more marriages and children and better health and overall wellbeingit is important to note that large companies generally pay well above the minimum wage and provide health insurance and retire ment benefits to all their employeesthey also extensively train their employees and help them move along in their careerswhile this would help small businesses far more than big businesses large companies should support the expansion of this program because it would foster growth and be great for lower paid american workerswhat should our country be doing to invest in its infrastructure how does the lack of a plan and investment hurt our economy infrastructure in america is a very broad and complex subjecthowever we do have a few suggestions on how to make it bettersimilar to companies planning for capacity needs it is quite clear that cities states and the federal government can also plan around their somewhat predictable needs for main tenance new roads and bridges increasing electrical requirements and other necessities to serve a growing populationinfrastruc ture should not be a stopstart process but an ongoing endeavor whereby intelligent invest   iiipublic policy ments are made continuouslyand the plan could also be sped up if necessary to help a weakening economyinfrastructure which could have a life of five to  years should not be expensed as a government debt but should be accounted for as an investment that could be financed separatelyborrowing money for consump tion is completely different from borrowing for something that has value for a long period of timeit’s important to streamline the approval process and approvals should run simultane ously and not sequentiallylast we need to assure that we have good infrastructure and not bridges to nowheregood infrastructure serving real needs is not only conducive to jobs in the short run but to growth in the long runprojects should be specifically identified with budgets and calen dars and with responsible parties namedhow should the us legal and regulatory systems be reformed to incentivize investment and job creation there are many reasons to be proud of our system of governmentthe usconstitution is the bedrock of the greatest democracy in the worldthe checks and balances put in place by the framers are still powerful limits on each branch’s powersand this year we witnessed one of the hallmarks of our great nation – the peaceful transition of power following a democratic electionour legal system including our nation’s commitment to the rule of law has long been a particular source of strength for our economywhen people communities and companies are confident in the stability and fairness of a country’s legal system they want to do business in that country and invest there and come from overseas to do soknowing that you will have access to courts for a fair and timely hearing on matters and that there are checks against abuses of power is importantas the discussion about areas for potential reform continues it is critical that these longterm us advantages are kept in mind and preservedin regulation for example i worry that the distribution of power has shiftedcongress through the administrative procedures act apa set out how regulators should publish draft rulesthe apa allows for comments on draft rules including comments on how a proposed rule will impact lending jobs and the economytoday however agencies often regulate through supervisory guidance that isn’t subject to the same commentary or checksthe function of interpretive guid ance is to clarify or explain existing law and should not be used to impose new substan tive requirementsnow is a good time to discuss how to reset this balancethere also is an opportunity to have a similar conversation around enforcement and litiga tionon the civil side we should look closely at whether statutory damages provisions work as intendedi read recently about a settlement under the fair and accurate credit transactions act in which plaintiffs received in excess of  million from a business that printed credit card receipts with the customer’s card expiration dateis that fair and proportionate – or is the result driven by a statutory damages framework that should be reconsidered and simply because the company agreed to the settlement does not mean it was the right resulthere is the fact the current dynamics make it very hard for companies to get their day in court – as the consequences of a loss at trial can be disproportionately severethis is particularly true in a governmentinitiated casethe collateral consequences of standing up to a regulator or losing at trial can be disproportionately negative when compared with the underlying issue or proposed settle ment and it can lead to the decision not to fight at all no matter what the merits of the case may bethe institute for legal reform for the chamber of commerce has framed this issue as follows   iiipublic policy “the socalled ‘trial penalty’ has virtually annihilated the constitutional right to a trialwhat are the consequences of a system in which the government is only rarely required to prove its case what are the implications of this on businesses both large and small ultimately what are the longterm prospects for entrepreneurship in an environment where even the most minor unintentional misstep may result in criminal investigation prosecution and loss of liberty” when you combine this with the fact that businesses have no “penaltyfree” way to challenge a new interpretation of the law the netnet result is a system that fosters legislation by enforcement actions and settlementssaid differently rather than congress expanding a law or a court testing a novel interpretation regulators and prosecutors make those deci sions and companies acquiescethe impact of these issues is further exacer bated by a system that allows for “multiple jeopardy” where federal state prudential and foreign agencies can “pile on” to any matter each seeking its own penalty without any mechanism to ensure that the multiple punishments are proportionate and fairit would be like getting pulled over by a local police officer and getting fined by your local town then by your county then by your state then by the federal government and then having the un weigh in since the car was made overseasto be clear we need regulators focused on the safety and soundness of all institutionswe need enforcement bodies focused on compliance with the lawbut we also need to preserve the system of checks and balances – when you cannot get your day in court on some really important issues we all sufferwe need to improve and reform our legal system because it is having a chilling impact on business formation risk taking and entrepreneurshipwhat price are we paying for the lack of understanding about business and free enterprise the united states needs to ensure that we maintain a healthy and vibrant economythis is what fuels job creation raises the standard of living for those who are hurting and positions us to invest in education technology and infrastructure in a program matic and sustainable way to build a better and safer future for our country and its peopleamerica’s military will be the best in the world only as long as we have the best economy in the worldbusiness plays a critical role as an engine of economic growth particularly our largest globally competitive american businessesas an example the thousand largest compa nies in america out of approximately  million employ nearly  million people in the united states and almost all of their employees get full medical and retirement benefits and extensive trainingin addition these companies account for more than  of the roughly  trillion spent annually on capital expenditurescapital expendi tures and rd spending drive productivity and innovation which ultimately drive job creation across the entire economyto support this we need a progrowth policy environment from the government that provides a degree of certainty around long standing issues that have proved frustrat ingly elusive to solvethe most pressing areas in which government business and other stakeholders can find common ground should include tax reform infrastructure investment education reform more favor able trade agreements and a sensible immi gration policy among otherswhen you read that small businesses and big businesses are pitted against each other or are not good for each other don’t believe it   why are america’s public equity markets so important how do we sustain them and strengthen corporate governance for more than two centuries the american free enterprise system has led to enormous prosperity for our country the creation of jobs increases in wages and savings and the emergence and growth of dynamic companiesbecause well managed and wellgoverned businesses are the engines of our economy good corporate governance must be more than just a catchphrase or fadit’s an imperative — especially when it comes to our publicly owned companiesthe chart on the right should be a cause for concernit notes that the number of public companies in the united states has declined  sincethere may very well be some logical and good explanations for why this is so eg companies can get capital more easily in the private markets and the private markets can be more efficient than they used to bei suspect there are other lessconstructive reasons which could be greatly expanded upon but i will merely list them below • excessive litigation including shareholder class action lawsuits • excessive and expensive reporting requirements • selfserving shareholder activity and proposals not intended to benefit the company • shareholder meetings that are hijacked by special interest groups and become a complete farce • too much shorttermism ie quarterly earnings at the expense of making good longterm investments • constant and frequent negative media scrutiny — some deserved and some not • boards spending more and more time on checkthebox legal and regulatory demands as opposed to the most important role of boards — management strategy major risks etcmany private equity companies often stress that it is better to be owned by them because they operate with commonsense corporate governance ie less checkthebox corporate governance — whether addressing board membership how a board spends its time management compensation or longterm results vs just quarterly earningsthe following page exhibits a letter drafted by a diverse group of financial leaders that outlines recommendations for commonsense corporate governance principles that would foster the health of our public companiesit is hard to estimate the cause and effect of all these factors but they are reasons for concernamerica’s public markets have been a key to america’s success and i suspect that years from now we may regret the damage we have done to them  public companies disappearing source world bank world federation of exchanges database                      decline   the health of america’s public corporations and financial markets — and public trust in both — is critical to economic growth and a better financial future for american workers retirees and investorsmillions of american families depend on these companies for work — our nearly  public companies account for a third of the nation’s private sector jobsand these same families and millions more also rely on public companies to help improve their financial future — they are heavily invested in these companies through mutual funds k and pension plans college savings plans and other accounts to buy a home send their children to college and save for retirementour future depends on these companies being managed effectively for longterm prosperity which is why the governance of american companies is so important to every americancorporate governance in recent years has often been an area of intense debate among investors corporate leaders and other stakeholdersyet too often that debate has generated more heat than lightwe represent some of america’s largest corporations as well as investment managers that as fiduciaries represent millions of individual savers and pension beneficiarieswe include corporate ceos the head of the canadian public pension fund and an activist investor and the heads of a number of institutional investors who manage money on behalf of a broad range of americansthis diverse group certainly holds varied opinions on corporate governancebut we share the view that constructive dialogue requires find ing common ground — a starting point to foster the economic growth that benefits shareholders employees and the economy as a wholeto that end we have worked to find commonsense principleswe offer these principles which can be found at wwwgovernanceprinciples org in the hope that they will promote further conversation on corporate governancethese principles include the following among others ■ truly independent corporate boards are vital to effective governance so no board should be beholden to the ceo or managementevery board should meet regularly without the ceo present and every board should have active and direct engagement with executives below the ceo level ■ diverse boards make better decisions so every board should have members with complementary and diverse skills backgrounds and experi encesit’s also important to balance wisdom and judgment that accompany experience and tenure with the need for fresh thinking and perspectives of new board members ■ every board needs a strong leader who is independent of managementthe board’s independent directors usually are in the best posi tion to evaluate whether the roles of chairman and ceo should be separate or combined and if the board decides on a combined role it is essential that the board have a strong lead independent director with clearly defined authorities and responsibilities ■ our financial markets have become too obsessed with quarterly earnings forecastscompanies should not feel obligated to provide earnings guidance — and should do so only if they believe that providing such guidance is beneficial to shareholders ■ a common accounting standard is critical for corporate transparency so while companies may use nongenerally accepted accounting principles “gaap” to explain and clarify their results they never should do so in such a way as to obscure gaapreported results and in particular since stock or optionsbased compensation is plainly a cost of doing business it always should be reflected in nongaap measurements of earnings and ■ effective governance requires constructive engagement between a company and its shareholdersso the company’s institutional investors making decisions on proxy issues important to longterm value creation should have access to the company its management and in some circumstances the board similarly a company its management and board should have access to institutional investors’ ultimate decision makers on those issuesthese recommendations are not meant to be absolutewe know that there is significant variation among our public companies and that their approach to corporate governance will inevitably and appropriately reflect those differencesbut we do hope our effort will be the beginning of a continuing dialogue that will benefit millions of americans by promoting trust in our nation’s public companieswe encourage others to join in that dialogueour country our economy and the future of our citizens depend on getting corporate governance

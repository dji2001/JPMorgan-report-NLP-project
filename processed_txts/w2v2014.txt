dear fellow shareholders seven years ago the world was shaken by the global financial crisisand since then our company has been dealing with extraordinary challenges as a result of that crisiswe have endured an unprecedented economic political and social storm — the impact of which will continue to be felt for years and possibly decades to comewhat is most striking to me in spite of all the turmoil is that our company became safer and stronger — and it never stopped supporting clients communities and the growth of economies around the worldi feel extraordinarily privileged to work for this great company with such talented peopleour management team and our employees do outstanding work every single day — sometimes under enormous pressure — while dealing with an extreme number of

activities associated with the safekeeping and servicing of assets  if you think back   or  years ago my predecessors and i struggled to try to build a great company which we hoped would emerge as an endgame winnerthe ultimate outcome was unclear – and many competitors did not survive this is true for most large scale consolidating industrieseven for those of us that did it was quite a struggletoday it is clear that our company is an endgame winner – both in the united states and glob ally – which is invaluable in any industryand while we have had some difficult times since the financial crisis the power of the franchise has shone throughwe also know that future success is not guaranteed – only consistently good management over a long period of time can ensure longterm success in any businessbut we certainly are in a very good placewe have delivered good multiyear financial results strong margins and returns and low volatility and have shown a great ability to adapt to changes — both from the marketplace and the regulatory environment we always compare our margins and returns with those of our best competitors in each businessthe chart below which is very similar to a chart we showed at our investor day shows some of these numbers forwe believe that the right discipline is to compare each of our businesses against its best competitorit is a mistake just to look at the consolidated numbers and compare them – every company has a different mix of businessesthe chart below also shows how our businesses compare in terms of margins iwe have an outstanding

conditions while investing and without taking excessive risk any company can improve earnings in the short run by taking on additional risk or cutting back on investmentsany company can grow rapidly if it takes on too much risk – but that usually is the kind of growth one comes to regretour margins have been quite good even as we have been investing for the long runthese investment expenses lower our shortterm returns but they are “good” expensesin addition to the tremendous amount that we invest annu ally in technology and infrastructure some examples of where we have invested over the past five years are –  retail branches in the united states –  wholesale offices abroad –  chase private client locations branches supported by  new private client advisors –  commercial banking expansion cities including approximately  commercial banking bankers –  small business bankers a good company always should be investing while it also is waste cutting ie cutting out any unnecessary expenseshowever i often have received bad advice on what are unnecessary expensesfor example spending on important strategic offsites research and development for innovation marketing that has a positive return – those are good expenseswe take a bus trip annu ally to visit branches operating centers and clientsit is both fun and enormously productive – and it is not an unnecessary expense – it makes us a better companyeven our annual retail national sales conference with the top  of our branch bankers loan officers and tellers is critical – we spend time working together we learn a lot and we get to thank these outstanding employees at an awards recognition dinnerwhile it is perfectly reasonable in tough times to dramatically reduce the cost of that conference it is unwise to cancel iti have been to every single one of these events since i started running bank one and i intend to continue that traditionwe earned adequate returns while building an increasingly stronger capital base during these challenging years our company has confronted difficult markets billions of dollars of additional regulatory costs billions of dollars of costs due to changes in prod ucts and services and unfortunately very high legal costsand we have had to hold an increasing amount of capital throughout this timewhile there is no question that these events did reduce our performance and returns we have been able to adapt meet the new rules and perform fairly well financially  ian outstanding franchise the chart below shows earnings the capital we returned to shareholders through divi

compound annual growth rate  ian outstanding franchise our mix of businesses works for clients — and for shareholders all companies including banks have a slightly different mix of businesses products and servicesthe most critical question is “does what you do work for clients” our franchise does work for clients by virtue of the fact that we are gaining share in each of our businesses and it works for shareholders by virtue of the fact that we are earning decent returns – and some of our competi tors are notother considerations are whether your company has “moats” – is it protected in some way from debilitating competition or events and has it performed consistently – in good times and in bad we believe that we have wellfortified moats in the form of economies of scale brand expertise tech nology and operations and – importantly – competitive advantages created by our ability to cross sell more on this later in this letterin addition we have performed fairly consis tently in good times and in badeven in  the worst year in perhaps  years for financial companies we earned  return on common tangible equity – not great but not bad all things consideredadditionally we have embedded strengths that are hard to replicate – the knowledge and cohesiveness of our people our longstanding client rela tionships our technology and product capa bilities our fortress balance sheet and our global presence in more than  countriesour mix of businesses leads to effective cross sell and substantial competitive advantageswe are not a conglomerate of separate unrelated businesses — we are an operating company providing financial services to consumers companies and communities a conglomerate is a group of unrelated busi nesses held under one umbrella holding companythere is nothing wrong with a conglomerate but we are not thatin our case whether you are an individual a company large or small or a government when you walk in the front door and talk with our bankers we provide you with essen tial financial products services and advicewe have a broad product offering and some distinct capabilities which combined create a mix of businesses that works well for each of our client segmentsconsumer satisfaction score        chase industry average big banks regional banks midsized banks  source jdpower usretail banking satisfaction study big banks defined as chase bank of america wells fargo citibank usbank pnc bank   ian outstanding franchise part of our mix of businesses however is not uniquewhile we divide our company into four distinct businesses the truth is that many regional banks do a lot of what three of our four businesses do ie chase consumer  community banking commercial banking and asset manage mentthe biggest difference between us and regional banks is our global corpo rate  investment bank and the nonus part of our asset management businessour broad product set and some of our unique capabilities some we inherited and some we built carefully over time combined with effective cross sell create substantial competitive advantagethe examples below make some of those advantages clear • commercial banking now generates  of our us investment banking businessthis means we are able to bring jpmorganchase’s exceptional investment bank to serve hundreds of midsized corporations and institu tions with the best global investment banking products and services in the industrywe can do this because our commercial bank is in hundreds of towns across the country where we can serve clients locally – person to person – and also bring the best of jpmorganchase to them • around the world we can bring excep tional private banking services to ceos and company owners or help private banking clients with their global commercial banking needs • because of our international footprint we bring global banking services – from cash management to ma – to approximately  of our more than  corporate client banking and middle market banking clients who are rapidly expanding overseas and who need these services from someone they know and can trust • we market chase paymentech our merchant acquirer through our branches to small businesses through the commer cial bank to midsized companies and through our corporate  investment bank to large multinational corporationsamerica’s financial system is still the best the world has ever seen — it is large and diverse — and it serves the best economy the world has ever seen which also is large and diverse america’s financial system still is the best the world has ever seen and it includes not just banks but asset managers private equity venture capital individual and corporate investors nonbank financial companies and public and private marketsin fact in the united states banks are a much smaller part of the financial system and the economy than in most other countriesand there is a great need for the services of all banks from large global banks to smaller regional and community banksour large global corporate  investment bank does things that regional and community banks simply cannot dowe offer unique capabili ties to large corporations large investors and governments including federal institutions states and citiesfor example we provide extensive credit lines or raise capital for these clients often in multiple jurisdictions and in multiple currencieswe essentially manage the checking accounts for these large insti tutions often in many different countrieson the average day jpmorganchase moves approximately  trillion for these types of institutionson the average day we raise or lend  billion for these institutionson the average day we buy or sell approximately  billion of securities to serve investors and issuersin  our corporate  invest ment bank raised  billion for states cities governments and universities including funds to renovate the historic arthur ashe tennis stadium in new york city revenue   ian outstanding franchise bonds to assist municipalities and hospitals and green bonds to finance environmentally beneficial projects such as green buildings clean water and renewable energyas a firm we spend approximately  million a year on research so that we can educate investors institutions and governments about econo mies markets and companiesthe needs of these clients will be met – one way or another – by large financial institutions that can bear the costs and risks involvedsimply put if it is not done by a large american financial institution it will be done by a large non american financial institutionregional and community banks are critical to their communities — in fact we are a huge supporter and their largest banking partnerthese banks are deeply embedded in their communities many of which are not served by larger banksthey have an intimate knowledge of the local economy and local small businesses which allows them to cost effectively serve those clientsjpmorganchase as a traditional “money center bank” and “bankers’ bank” in fact is the largest banker in america to regional and commu nity bankswe provide them with many services so they can continue to serve their clientsfor example we directly lend to them we process payments for them we finance some of their mortgage activities we raise capital for them both debt and equity we advise them on acquisitions and we buy and sell securities for themwe also provide them with interest rate swaps and foreign exchange both for themselves – to help them hedge some of their exposures – and for their clientshowever large does not necessarily mean complex and things should be complex only for a good reason many of the activities we do that are consid ered large are easy to understandall of our  chase consumer branches do essen tially the same thing and many of our large global transactions are not any more compli cated than a loan for a middle market clientwhile we agree with the concept that you should keep things as simple as possible some things by their very nature are more complexand that complexity cannot be reduced by wishful thinkingin fact basic lending whether to a large company or a midsized company is one of the more complex things we do because one must understand the economy the nature of the business and often the types of collat eral involvedthere are many judgmental factors to consider as well which might include the character of the borrower the growth prospects of the business and an understanding of the products and services and technology of the businessthere are understandable questions about the role that large financial institutions playsome of these questions make people nervous in part because they do not under stand the larger picturethese are important questions and we always are willing to help explain what we do and why we do ittaken in small component pieces these activities generally are easier to understandwhile some may criticize a bank’s activities instead of taking the time to understand them this does not contribute to a genuinely construc tive dialogue around the role of bankspeople also should ask themselves one basic question why do banks offer these services the fact is almost everything we do is because clients want and need our various and sometimes complex services we do many activities that are ancillary to clients’ direct needs but we must do these things to provide clients with what they needfor example in order to support our operation we run global data centers we hedge our own exposures and we maintain liquid pools of investments i would venture to say that banking is not as complex as making airplanes discovering effective pharmaceuticals building safe cars developing innovative electronics and of course understanding nuclear physicsthere are huge benefits to the complexity involved in those other industries – but there also are sometimes negative consequencesthe question for society is are we in total   ian outstanding franchise better off or worse off because of some of the great products and services that come with complexity the answer in our opinion is a resounding yes though you should always strive to minimize the risksbut we want to acknowledge that the difference with banks as pointed out by critics is that if and when they make mistakes they can severely harm the economythis concern is legitimate and i will talk about it in a later sectionlarger does not necessarily mean more risky for example many large banks had no problem navigating the financial crisis while many smaller banks went bankruptmany of these smaller banks went bankrupt because they were undiversified meaning that most of their lending took place in a specific geographya good example was when oil collapsed in the late stexas banks went bankrupt because of their direct exposure to oil companies and also because of their exposure to real estate whose value depended largely on the success of the oil businesssince the crisis began seven years ago more than  smaller banks have gone bankrupt and jpmorganchase has contrib uted approximately  billion to the federal deposit insurance corporation to help pay for the resolution of those banksand yes there are both costs and benefits to size and complexity the benefits of size are obvious huge econo mies of scale the ability to serve large clients and make large investments and safe diversi fication among othersand yes there some times are clear negatives to size – usually in the form of arrogance greed complacency or lack of attention to detail there also are many small businesses afflicted with these diseases – they kill companies both large and small good companies get the benefits of size and continuously are fighting off the negativesand there are lots of winners and losers particularly as industries consolidatein every industry you will see companies that benefit from size – and those that don’tour size and strength allow us to create benefits for society by helping economies and communities around the world grow and prosper we are able to do our part in supporting communities and economies around the world because we are strong stable and permanentand because of this strength and stability we can continue to support our clients in good times and more important in the toughest of timesthe most important thing we can do is keep our company healthy and vibrant so that we can serve the needs of customers consumers and businesses and help local economies and the thousands of cities and various communities around the world where we operate to grow and prosperin addition we strongly believe in being a good corporate citizenwe are one of the most philanthropic companies in the world we give away more than  million a year but we are able to do much more than provide moneywe bring the skills resources and global knowledge of our entire firm to support the economic growth and prog ress of communities across the globeone example is our research such as studying how our communities analyze labor market conditions so they can get better at training people for jobs or how cities can further develop their economiessee peter scher’s corporate responsibility letter on page  for more details on our efforts to support cities and communities around the globefollowing are three unique initiatives that we’d like to focus on jpmorganchase institutewe will be offi cially launching an exciting new initiative called the jpmorganchase institute which is a global think tank dedicated to deliv ering datarich analyses expert insights and thought leadership for the public gooddrawing on the knowledge market access broad relationships and resources across the firm the jpmorganchase institute will help inform both business and policy deci sions by grounding them with facts data and thoughtful analysisour aim is to help decision makers – policymakers businesses and nonprofit leaders – appreciate the scale   ian outstanding franchise • we supported nonprofit organizations including focus hope in their efforts to help people gain skills from job training programs • we helped small businesses get access to the advice training and other resources needed to grow including a new commer cial kitchen at eastern market that will allow more food businesses to expand • we provided lending for development – both commercial development to let businesses like global titanium expand jobs and residential development and new construction of apartment buildings in detroit’s urban core and neighborhoods • we created the detroit service corps to bring more than  of our top managers to work full time with detroit nonprofits to help them analyze challenges solve problems and give them the best chance for successhelping detroit’s economy recover and thrive would be a shining example of amer ican resilience and ingenuity at workmilitary and veteransanother effort that we want you to know about is what jpmorganchase has done to help position military members veterans and their families for success in their postservice lives through employment housing and educational programsin  jpmorganchase and  other companies launched the  jobs mission setting a goal of collectively hiring  veteransthe  jobs mission now includes more than  companies that have collectively hired more than  veterans since  and has pledged to hire a total of  veteransjpmorganchase hired over  veterans in  nearly a  yearoveryear increase for a total of nearly  veterans hired sincefurther we expanded our employ ment programs to address the unique needs of women veterans and military spouseswe hope that this makes you as proud of jpmorganchase as it does for all of us granularity diversity and interconnected ness of the global economic system to inform smarter decisions and good policies that advance global prosperity for consumers businesses and countriesthe research agenda will include groundbreaking analytic work on the financial behavior of individ uals insights on the small business sector and expert profiling of global trade and capital flowsdetroitwe brought all of our resources to bear in a special coordinated way which we never have done before to try to help the city of detroitwe have been doing business there for more than  years and already are the largest consumer commercial and investment bank serving detroit’s consumers and companiesbut we wanted to do more to help kickstart the city’s recoverythis effort is a  million commitment which includes investments philanthropy and our people working in tandem with a set of city leaders who have come together to work toward a common purposeour initial interest in undertaking this effort was made possible because of our faith in the extraordi nary work and talent of mayor duggan and govsnyder and kevyn orr who recently left as emergency managertheir dedica tion to coherently comprehensively and pragmatically attacking the city’s enormous problems made us want to do morein fact everything we have done to help is the result of asking a broad array of the city’s leaders what they really needed and then working with them to come up with some creative solutionslet me give just a few examples • we expanded the city’s effort to systemati cally map every single parcel in detroit and provided the technology assistance so that residents can use their phones to continually update the database • we helped provide financing for people who wanted to purchase land or to buy and renovate homes   iiour paramount responsibility to society and to our clients is to be there in good times and bad times we have a huge obligation to society – not only must we never fail but we need to be steadfastnever failing means having the financial strength liquidity margins and strong and diverse earnings where you can weather any stormit also means having the ability to adapt survive and even thrive through the cyclessteadfast means that you will be there no matter what happens and being there means that you can continue to properly serve your clients even in tough timesin the toughest of times it is not about making a profitit is about helping your clients survivei should point out that in the toughest of times particularly in  jpmorganchase rolled over and extended credit to small and mediumsized businesses a total of  billion to governments and nonprofits a total of  billion and to large corporations a total of  trillioni will talk more about this laterwe extensively manage our risks so that we can survive in any scenariothe federal reserve’s stress test is a tough measure of our survival capability — though our ability to survive is stronger than that test implies we are fanatics about stress testing and risk managementit is in our best interest to protect this company – for the sake of our shareholders clients employees and commu nitiesif you went to our risk committee meetings you would see a number of profes sionals working to thoughtfully manage and reduce our risk – we don’t want a bunch of cowboys trying to increase itwe run hundreds of stress tests a week across our global credit and trading operations to ensure our ability to withstand and survive many bad scenariosthese scenarios include events like what happened in  other historically damaging events and also new situations that might occurour stress tests include analyzing extremely bad outcomes relating to the eurozone russia and the middle eastregarding the eurozone we must be prepared for a potential exit by greecewe continu ally stress test our company for possible repercussions resulting from such an event even though in our opinion after the initial turmoil it is quite possible that it would prompt greater structural reform efforts by countries that remainalso regarding geopo litical crises one of our firm’s great thinkers michael cembalest reviewed all of the major geopolitical crises going back to the korean war which included multiple crises involving the soviet union and countries in the middle east among othersonly one of these events derailed global financial markets the  war in the middle east that resulted in an oil embargo caused oil prices to quadruple and put much of the world into recessionwe stress test frequently virtually every country and all credit market and interest rate exposures and we analyze not only the primary effects but the secondary and tertiary consequencesand we stress test for extreme moves – like the one you recently saw around oil pricesrest assured we extensively manage our risksthe federal reserve’s comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar stress test is another tough measure of our survival capabilitythe stress test is good for our industry in that it clearly demonstrates the ability of each and every bank to be properly capitalized even after an extremely difficult environmentspecifically the test is a ninequarter scenario where unemployment suddenly goes to  home prices drop  equities plummet approximately  credit losses skyrocket and marketmaking loses a lot of money like in the lehman brothers crisiswe build for the long term — we manage throughthecycle and we always are prepared for the toughest of times   iibuilt for the long term to make sure the test is severe enough the fed essentially built into every bank’s results some of the insufficient and poor decisions that some banks made during the crisiswhile i don’t explicitly know i believe that the fed makes the following assumptions • the stress test essentially assumes that certain models don’t work properly partic ularly in credit this clearly happened with mortgages in  • the stress test assumes all of the negatives of market moves but none of the positives • the stress test assumes that all banks’ risk weighted assets would grow fairly signifi cantly the fed wants to make sure that a bank can continue to lend into a crisis and still pass the test this could clearly happen to any one bank though it couldn’t happen to all banks at the same time • the stress test does not allow a reduction for stock buybacks and dividendsagain many banks did not do this until late in the last crisisi believe the fed is appropriately conserva tively measuring the abovementioned aspects and wants to make sure that each and every bank has adequate capital in a crisis without having to rely on good management decisions perfect models and rapid responseswe believe that we would perform far better under the fed’s stress scenario than the fed’s stress test implieslet me be perfectly clear – i support the fed’s stress test and we at jpmorganchase think that it is important that the fed stress test each bank the way it doesbut it also is important for our share holders to understand the difference between the fed’s stress test and what we think actu ally would happenhere are a few examples of where we are fairly sure we would do better than the stress test would imply • we would be far more aggressive on cutting expenses particularly compensa tion than the stress test allows • we would quickly cut our dividend and stock buyback programs to conserve capitalin fact we reduced our dividend dramatically in the first quarter of  and stopped all stock buybacks in the first quarter of  • we would not let our balance sheet grow quicklyand if we made an acquisition we would make sure we were properly capitalized for itwhen we bought wash ington mutual wamu in september of  we immediately raised  billion in common equity to protect our capital positionthere is no way we would make an acquisition that would leave us in a precarious capital position • and last our trading losses would unlikely be  billion as the stress test showsthe stress test assumes that dramatic market moves all take place on one day and that there is very little recovery of valuesin the real world prices drop over time and the volatility of prices causes bidask spreads to widen – which helps market makersin a realworld example in the six months after the lehman brothers crisis jpmorgan’s actual trading results were  billion of losses – a significant portion of which related to the bear stearns acqui sition – which would not be repeatedwe also believe that our trading exposures are much more conservative today than they were during the crisisfinally and this should give our shareholders a strong measure of comfort during the actual financial crisis of  and  we never lost money in any quarterwe hope that over time capital planning becomes more predictablewe do not believe that banks are trying to “game” the systemwhat we are trying to do is understand the regulatory goals and objectives so we can properly embed them in our decisionmaking processit is critical for the banking system that the treatment of capital is coherent and   iibuilt for the long term consistent over time and is not in any way capriciouscapital is precious and it needs to be deployed intelligently in the business or properly returned to shareholdersif share holders do not have a clear understanding of capital management and have unreasonable expectations then that capital will be devaluedthis is a bad outcome for all involvedwhile there always will be cycles we need to keep our eye on the important things too — the outlook for longterm growth is excellent the needs of countries companies investor clients and individuals will continue to grow over timethe chart below shows some of the longterm growth that is expected in some critical areas including the underlying growth of gross domestic product and trade investablefinancial assets infrastructure and capital markets activitiesthis is the fuel that will drive our business in the futuretherefore we take a longterm perspective on investinghow we currently view low net interest margins is a good example of making decisions for the long run to capture our share of the growth in our underlying businesses we need to continu ally invest in bankers branches and capabili ties research products and technology to drive down our costs and better serve our clientsit is a lot of hard work that needs to be supported by all of our critical functions from finance and human resources to opera tions and controlsthis kind of investing should not be done in a stopstart way to manage shortterm profitabilityquarterly earnings – even annual earnings – frequently are the result of actions taken over the past five or  yearsour company continued to invest through the crisis – often when others

international monetary fund world bank mckinsey jpmorganchase analysis   estimate   iibuilt for the long term a very good current example of how we view investing and longterm decision making is how we are dealing with the squeeze on our net interest margins nim due to extremely low interest ratesthe best example of this is in our consumer business where nim has gone from  to  from  tothis spread reduction has reduced our net interest income by  billion from  billion to  billion – or if you look at it per account from  tosince we strongly believe this is a temporary phenomenon and we did not want to take more risk to increase our nim which we easily could have done we continued to open new accountsover those years we added  million accounts – and in fact very good sizable accountsthis has reduced our operating margins from  to  but we don’t carewhen normal interest rates return we believe this will add  billion to revenue and improve our oper ating margin to more thanour longterm view means that we do not manage to temporary pe ratios — the tail should not wag the dog priceearnings pe ratios like stock prices are temporary and volatile and should not be used to run and build a businesswe have built one great franchise our way which has been quite successful for some timeas long as the business being built is a real franchise and can stand the test of time one should not overreact to mrmarketthis does not mean we should not listen to what investors are saying – it just means we should not overreact to their comments – particularly if their views reflect tempo rary factorswhile the stock market over a long period of time is the ultimate judge of performance it is not a particularly good judge over a short period of timea more consistent measure of value is our tangible book value which has had healthy growth over timebecause of our conservative accounting tangible book value is a very good measure of the growth of the value of our companyin fact when mrmarket gets very moody and depressed we think it might be a good time to buy back stocki often have received bad advice about what we should do to earn a higher pe ratiobefore the crisis i was told that we were too conservatively financed and that more leverage would help our earningsoutsiders said that one of our weaknesses in fixed income trading was that we didn’t do enough collateralized debt obligations and structured investment vehiclesand others said that we couldn’t afford to invest in initiatives like our own branded credit cards and the buildout of our chase private client franchise during the crisisexamples like these are exactly the reasons why one should not follow the herdwhile we acknowledge that our pe ratio is lower than many of our competitors’ ratio one must ask whyi believe our stock price has been hurt by higher legal and regulatory costs and continues to be depressed due to future uncertainty regarding bothwe still face legal uncertainty though we are determined to reduce it over timethough we still face legal uncertainty particularly around foreign exchange trading we are determined to reduce it and believe it will diminish over timei should point out that while we certainly have made our share of costly mistakes a large portion of our legal expense over the last few years has come from issues that we acquired with bear stearns and wamuthese problems were far in excess of our expectationsvirtually  of all our mortgage legal costs which have been extraordinary they now total close to  billion resulted from those two acquisi tionsin the bear stearns case we did not anticipate that we would have to pay the penalties we ultimately were required to payand in the wamu case we thought we had robust indemnities from the federal deposit insurance corporation and the wamu receiv ership but as part of our negotiations with the department of justice that led to our big mortgage settlement we had to give those upin case you were wondering no we would not do something like bear stearns   iibuilt for the long term again – in fact i don’t think our board would let me take the callthe wamu deal might still make sense but at a much lower price to make up for the ongoing legal uncertainty including the government’s ability to take away our bargainedfor indemnitiesi did not and perhaps could not have anticipated such a turn of eventsthese are expensive lessons that i will not forgetpart of the issue around legal costs is that banks are now frequently paying penalties to five or six different regulators both domestic and international on exactly the same issuethis is an unprecedented approach that probably warrants a serious policy discussion – especially if those regulators as at least some of them have acknowledged don’t take into account what is being paid to the othersfor now it’s simply a reality for big banks and certainly for us that when one or more employees do something wrong we’ll hear from multiple regulators on the subjectthe good news is that our legal costs are coming down and we hope will normalize byuncertainty remains around regulatory require ments though we believe this will diminish over time toothat uncertainty is particularly acute around the extra capital that jpmorganchase will have to hold because of the new global systemically important bank gsib rules the ultimate impact of the volcker rule total lossabsorbing capacity ccar and recovery  resolutionand it’s because of that uncertainty that a majority of the time i spend with analysts and investors these days is devoted to regulationvery little time is spent talking about the actual business like client transactions market share gains or other business driversmany questions still remain and they are hard to explain or are difficult to answer including why did american regulators simply double the gsib capital requirements for american banks versus all other global banks will higher capital requirements be added later given that much uncertainty which is greater for jpmorganchase than for most other banks it is understandable that people would pay less for our earnings than they otherwise might payhaving said all this the contours of all of the new regulations have emerged and we believe that regulatory uncertainty will diminish over timeand we hope so will the drag on our pe ratiothink like a longterm investor manage like an operator so our ultimate goal is to think like a long term investor – build great franchises strengthen moats and have good through thecycle financial resultsachieve the benefits of scale and eliminate the negativesdevelop great longterm achievable strate giesand manage the business relentlessly like a great operatorfinally continue to develop excellent management that keeps it all goingas thomas edison said “vision without execution is hallucination”   we have meaningfully simplified the company while i have said that it is good housekeeping to keep our company as simple as possible we have done an extraordinary amount of cleaning out this past yearmore important last year we said that we would do it and this year we actually did itthe chart below shows that we did it by shedding businesses reducing products and materially derisking by reducing certain types of clients that simply create too much risk in the new worldin total we have reduced approximately  billion in assets through this effortall of this makes the work of our compliance and control executives that much easier as they can focus more on what’s importantiiiwe are well on our way to having fortress controls the intense effort over the last few years now is yielding real results and will go a long way in protecting the company in the futurewhen we are done we hope not just to have met the heightened expectations of our regu lators but to have exceeded themin addition to successfully completing ccar which we will strive to do every year there are other examples of tangible progressfollowing are some of our accomplishments • strengthened compliancewe have added approximately  people across the firm with a mission to strengthen our compliance capabilitieswe have further aligned global leadership to drive focus and consistency across key risk areas such as amlbsa antimoney laundering we will successfully navigate the new global financial architecture and we

procedures and technology support • new antimoney laundering systems deployedwe have implemented mantas an industryleading transaction monitoring platform for all us dollar payment transactionsthis provides a signifi cant improvement in our transaction monitoring capabilities and allows us to decommission multiple less effective legacy systemswe also have upgraded our processes and technology support in aml investigations and sanctionswe have more to do but a strong foundation is in place • foreign correspondent banking reviewgiven the regulatory scrutiny around these activities we have exited many relation ships with foreign correspondent banks where we have riskrelated concerns or where we needed to simplify our busi nessin addition to the relationship exits we have improved our controls for foreign correspondent banking activities including enhancing our technology to better monitor us dollar correspondent bank transactions – which allowed us to implement  new transaction monitoring scenarios to better track millions of trans actions each day • enhanced controls in connection with payday lender practiceswe reviewed our poli cies systems and processes to decrease financial burdens on our customers and hinder payday lenders’ ability to engage in predatory collection practicesand then we did the following eliminated multiple return item fees enhanced our policy and systems for stop payment requests and allowed account closure with a pending transaction andor a negative balance nacha rules originally did not allow a bank to close an account with a pending transactionconsumers wanted to close the account to stop payday lenders from trying to take money from the account on a daily basis in addition we are working with nacha to develop new standards for the entire industry • mortgage servicing improvementsas one of the united states’ largest mortgage lenders some of our practices were not designed to handle the unprecedented increase in volume that occurred as a result of the financial crisistherefore we reviewed the areas that needed enhance ment and took the appropriate actionswe focused on improving our operating model we dedicated more than  employees to assist customers that were having difficulty making payments and we improved our communications with customers to provide better counseling and more clarity about the options avail ablewe also invested more than  hours of our technology employees’ time to improve our mortgage servicing business including enhancing the loan modification application to improve the systems that track and manage customer complaints and responses • model reviewmore than  employees are working in model risk and devel opmentin  this highly special ized team completed over  model reviews implemented a system to assess the ongoing performance of the  most complex models in the firm and continued to enhance capital and loss models for our companyfortunately most of our strategies stay essentially the same many banks will have to make some fairly drastic changes to their strategies and because various banks are facing different overarching constraints those strategies may be dramatically dissimilarwe are fortunate that our strategies will remain essentially the same which allows us to avoid the upheaval both internally and externally with clients that often comes when strategies need to be changed dramatically   iiia new global financial architecture however a small percentage of our products and services will require some surgery more on that laterin addition because some companies are making large strategic moves we would expect to see an ongoing shift in market shares and pricingit is possible that we will benefit from both of these trendswhile uncertainty remains

believe we will be able to successfully accomplish all of itwe have spoken about many of these rules and requirements in the past so we won’t go into greater detail here other than on the new gsib capital rules which will have some material effects on some of our businessesintense effort is going into understanding and adapting to the new gsib capital ruleslast year we described how we had to manage the company to satisfy several new constraints all of the liquidity leverage capital and ccar requirementsto do this we were pushing these new rules and requirements all the way down to the product and client levelsthe gsib capital rules are a new constraint that we also need to manage to and for jpmorganchase they possibly are the most important constraint though this may change over timethere fore we also need to push the new gsib rules to the product and client levelsunlike rwa which lets one measure the risk embedded in each asset and thus the capital needed to hold against it gsib is multivariategsib is not a simple calcula tionit requires thousands of calculations and it does not look at just assets – it looks at products services assets type of client ie international and financial or corporate and collateral type among others in order to determine capital levelsgsib will have its highest impact on non operating deposits gross derivatives the clearing business in general and certain clients particularly financial institutions including central banksat the end of the day we believe that we can manage through this process and reduce our capital require ments while maintaining our core fran chisesto the extent that these changes materially impact clients we will do it thoughtfully and carefully and help them find appropriate alternativesgsib is not a direct measure of riskthe gsib calculations show that jpmorganchase is the most global systemically important bank and therefore we have to hold more capital than any other bank in the worldsome of our shareholders believe that this designa tion implies that before the additional capital is held we may be the riskiest institution toobut gsib is not a true measure of risk like rwa or ccar and as shareholders have mentioned to me many of these measures do not indicate how they would look at risk ie margins earnings diversi fication and actual performance in tough times in addition to criteria such as capital and liquidity in fact parts of gsib are very risk insensi tive – for example it does not measure our actual and largest risks in credit markets still our largest exposures – and it adds a lot of capital for some activities that have absolutely no risk involvedone example will suffice we take nonoperating deposits deposits that are very short term in nature from investors so they can manage their shortterm cash needs from central banks and large financial institutionswe have approximately  billion of nonoperating deposits a large portion from financial institutions which we immediately turn around and deposit at the federal reserve and this is riskfree to uswe mostly do this as an accommodation to large institutions that need to move extensive sums of money around and we generate minimal earnings from this activitywe recently announced that we are going to reduce these deposits by  billion which in the context of the firm’s broader actions will reduce our common equity requirements by approxi mately  billion since these changes involve some of the largest financial institu tions in the world we are doing this very carefully and are trying to make sure that clients have access to alternatives such as access to money market funds and direct access to federal reserve facilities   iiia new global financial architecture we hope to learn a lot more about the gsib calculationsmany questions remain which we hope will be answered over time such as • it is unclear it has not been made trans parent to us how and why these calcula tions are supposed to reflect systemic riskin addition they are relative calculations which means that even if we and every body else all reduced these exposures our surcharge would not change while presumably systemic risk would drop • it is unclear how these calculations take into consideration the extensive number of new rules and regulations that are supposed to reduce systemic risk ie total lossabsorbing capacity net stable funding ratio liquidity coverage ratio supplemen tary leverage ratio and the new recovery  resolution rules • it is unclear why the us regulators doubled the calculations versus everyone else in the world particularly since the us banking system as a percentage of the us economy is smaller than in most other countriesgsib is important and we take it seriouslythe gsib capital surcharge however calculated is an important part of our capital needsand since we are outsized relative to our competitors our capital surcharge currently is estimated as  of riskweighted assets yet many of our competitors are between  of riskweighted assets we will be more comfortable when the surcharge is reducedwe already have begun to lower the surcharge by  and over time expect to do more than thatmarianne lake and daniel pinto gave details on this topic in their investor day presentationsthe regula tors have made it clear that these are impor tant measures of global systemic risk and they have given us a clear road map to how we can reduce these exposures – and we are going to take that roadwe must and will meet the regulators’ demands on recovery  resolution — whatever it takes a critical part of eliminating “too big to fail” is meeting the regulators’ demands on recovery  resolutionthe recovery plan is the first line of defense in a crisis situ ation and serves as the road map for how to prevent the firm from actually failingit gives the regulators the comfort that the firm has done sufficient upfront planning and analysis and has an outline for how the firm could recover if confronted with a severe financial crisisthe plan essentially helps the regulators understand the comprehensive set of alternatives and actions available to enable the firm to fully recover and prevent a failureresolution plans on the other hand are the playbooks for how the company can be restructured or unwound in an orderly way in the event of a failure so that other banks and the general economy would not sufferthe plans outline for the regulators a set of strategies necessary information and detailed plans by legal entityfor instance jpmorganchase has reported that it has  legal entities and branches housing the vast majority of the firm’s essential operations and businesseseach legal entity has to be understood by the regulators and must have distinct intercompany agreements and a comprehensive plan in place to manage the legal entity in the event that it needs to be resolvedwe have taken these requirements very seriously as evidenced by the more than  people working diligently on the exten sive recovery  resolution requirementsin addition we are working to reduce the number of entities we have and to simplify our structure and interentity arrangementswe need to satisfy all of our regulators on these plans and we will do whatever it takes to meet their expectationsthere have been two critical developments toward giving governments and regula tors comfort on recovery  resolution which according to some key regulators will effectively end too big to fail and will   iiia new global financial architecture be completed infirst the regulators have almost finished plans around total loss absorbing capacity which will require large banks to hold a lot of additional longterm debt which could be converted to equity in the event of a failure and thereby enable the firm to remain open to serve customers and marketssecond the industry agreed to put in place specific rules and guidelines on how to deal globally with derivatives contracts of a failed institutionthis gives regulators and governments the knowledge that in a failure derivatives contracts can be properly managed and will not make the situation worsethe industry will be stronger and safer because of all of the new regulations and the future is bright for wellrun banks there is no question that today the global banking system is safer and stronger – possibly more so than it has ever beenthat is not to say that the changes do not create a whole range of challenges complexities and new risks which we will talk about in the next sectionbut at the end of the day the system will be safer and more stable than everi may sound a little like voltaire’s optimistic character drpangloss for saying this but i am hopeful that in the next five to  years highquality banks will be thriving in their work to support economies and help society   we already have spoken about the fact that most of our strategy will stay essentially the same and that while some areas may require a little surgery we strongly believe we will be able to successfully navigate the new worldsome of that surgery will slow down our growth a little bit in certain areas but we are quite optimistic that we can grow in othersmost of our growth will be organic — we have been doing this successfully for a decade — and opportunities abound we are optimistic that all of our businesses can grow and below i describe some initia tives that are particularly excitingchase private client started as a gleam in our eye back inchase private client branches are dedicated to serving our affluent clients’ investment needsfrom one test branch which didn’t go very well but fortunately we kept on trying we now have more than  chase private client officesthey now manage investments and deposits of  billionwhile the branch buildout is essen tially complete we think the potential for growth remains largesmall businesswe are making our premier products and services work better together for a more holistic experience for our small business customers whose time and attention should be spent on running their business not going to the bankwe see a huge oppor tunity in this fragmented market – there is no dominant bank for the  million small businesses in the united statesat jpmorganchase we serve  million american small businesses across business banking card services and chase commerce solutions and we have successfully grown all of these busi nesseswe want to become the easiest bank to do business with and we are working hard to speed applications simplify forms and add digital conveniencesfor example we want a small business to fill out an application that can qualify it for ink® our small business credit card paymentech deposits and loans all at oncewe believe that if we bundle the services that small businesses really want and also provide meaningful advice we can dramatically grow this businesslooking ahead we know small businesses become large companies at a much more rapid pace than in years pastserving these compa nies well now can solidify longterm client relationships that could span several lines of business in the futureexcellent prospects for our corporate  investment bankour corporate  investment bank is an example of a business that has had exceptional relative multiyear perfor manceand even recently when it has been under a lot of regulatory pressure due to higher capital constraints and other regula tory demands the business has been able to earn a  return on equityit is an endgame winner and it benefits substan tially from the rest of the company which helps drive its bestinclass resultshowever in our current environment we don’t expect a lot of growth or robust returns as we adjust to the new worldbut we continue to believe that the long run is quite attractiveat investor day we showed that the corporate  investment bank in  was   or  in eight of the  product categories that we are innow we are   or  in  of the  product categories that we are inbut the exciting part is a program that daniel pinto calls path to  which shows when you divide those  businesses into subbusinesses and geographies there are lots of areas where we are not close to   or  and in most of those places we should be able to improveso as the busi ness goes through an inordinate amount of change the underlying needs of our clients continue to grow and we will grow with them and believe we can gain share tooivwe have a solid strategy and believe our future outlook is very good — but as usual there still are a lot of things to think and worry about  excludes legal expense   ivsolid strategy and future outlook we are going to do a better job of covering family and private offices in both the private bank and the investment bankfamily offices have become larger more sophisticated and more global and they actively buy minority or whole stakes in businessesmore than  families across the globe had assets of  billion or more intogether they control over  trillion in assets a number that has grown in excess of  sincewhile jpmorgan already works with many of these families as clients we believe we can do a far better job of

have the best private bank in the united states our business still is rather small and there is plenty of room to growthis is even truer in asia pacific and latin americathe chart below shows how strong our business is and illustrates that there is plenty of room to grow our market share internationallyretail banking presence still has room to growwhile we cannot acquire a retail bank in the united states we can – and intend to – enter cities where we have never beenwe will keep those cities we might choose to enter a surprise – but we hope to begin doing this inand remember when we enter

fraudulent activities before they impact our clients we are helping our clients mitigate costs by opti mizing the collateral they post in support of derivatives contracts and we are highlighting insights to our merchant acquiring and cobrand partnersthere always will be new emerging competitors that we need to keep an eye on new competitors always will be emerging – and that is even truer today because of new technologies and large changes in regula tionsthe combination of these factors will have a lot of people looking to compete with banks because they have fewer capital and regulatory constraints and fewer legacy systemswe also have a healthy fear of the potential effects of an uneven playing field which may be developingbelow are some areas that we are keeping an eye onlarge banks outside the united states are comingin terms of profitability the top two chinese banks are almost twice our sizethirty years ago industrial and commercial bank of china operated in only a handful of countries but it now has branches or subsidiaries in more than  countriesit has a huge home market and a strategic reason to follow the large rapidly growing global chinese multinationals overseasit may take  years but we’d be foolish to discount their ambition and resourceswe’re also seeing worldclass banks emerge and grow in places like india and brazil and japanese and cana dian banks are coming on strong toomany of these banks are supported in their expan sionary efforts by their government and will not need to live by some of the same rules that we in the united states must adhere to including capital requirementswe welcome the competition but we are worried that an uneven playing field may hamper us many years from nowsilicon valley is comingthere are hundreds of startups with a lot of brains and money working on various alternatives to tradi tional bankingthe ones you read about most are in the lending business whereby the firms can lend to individuals and small businesses very quickly and – these enti ties believe – effectively by using big data to enhance credit underwritingthey are very good at reducing the “pain points” in that they can make loans in minutes which might take banks weekswe are going to work hard to make our services as seam less and competitive as theirsand we also are completely comfortable with partnering where it makes sensecompetitors are coming in the payments areayou all have read about bitcoin merchants building their own networks paypal and paypal lookalikespayments are a critical business for us – and we are quite good at itbut there is much for us to learn in terms of realtime systems better encryption tech niques and reduction of costs and “pain points” for customerssome payments systems particularly the ach system controlled by nacha cannot function in real time and worse are continu ously misused by free riders on the systemthere is a true cost to allowing people to move moneyfor example it costs retailers  basis points to use cash due to preventing fraud and providing security etcand retailers often will pay  to an intermediary to guarantee that a check is gooda guaranteed check essentially is the same as a debit card transaction for which they want to payfor some competi tors free riding is the only thing that makes their competition possiblehaving said that we need to acknowledge our own flawswe need to build a realtime system that prop erly charges participants for usage allows for good customer service and minimizes fraud and bad behaviorrest assured we analyze all of our competi tors in excruciating detail – so we can learn what they are doing and develop our own strategies accordingly   ivsolid strategy and future outlook cybersecurity fraud and privacy need intensive investment on the part of your entire company and we must do it in collaboration with the government and regulators matt zames describes on page  some of the efforts we are making on cyberwhat i want to emphasize to our shareholders is the absolute critical and immediate need to combat cybersecurity threats and the related issues of fighting fraud and protecting privacyin these areas we will do whatever it takes to protect the company and its clientsregarding privacy i do not believe that most people fully understand what no longer is private and how their information is being bought sold and usedas a bank we are appropriately restricted in how we can use our data but we have found many exam ples of our data being misused by a third partywe are going to be very aggressive in limiting and controlling how third parties can use jpmorganchase datait is critical that government and business and regulators collaborate effectively and in real timecybersecurity is an area where government and business have been working well together but there is much more to be doneand if it is not done in a concerted way we all will pay a terrible pricethe banking system is far safer than it has been in the past but we need to be mindful of the consequences of the myriad new regulations and current monetary policy on the money markets and liquidity in the marketplace — particularly if we enter a highly stressed environment there are many new rules and in conjunc tion with current monetary policy they already are having a large effect on money markets and liquidity in the marketplaceone famous scientist once said “a rule of three art a statistical specification with more than three explanatory variables is meaningless” simply put it is impossible to figure out the cumulative effect of all these changes even in a benign environmentbut what is far more important is what the effect of these changes might be if we enter a stressed environmentas a risk policy matter we need to make the assumption that there will be unpredictable and unintended conse quences – sometimes these are to good effect but what we need to worry about are those that have a potentially bad effectin the rest of this section we will look at how the table is set – what is going on that is the same or different than in the pastlater in this section we will speculate on what might happen differently if we enter a new crisismost important we will enter the next crisis with a banking system that is stronger than it has ever been each individual bank is safer than before and the banking sector overall is stronger and sounder because among other things • capital levels are far higher today than before the crisis and by some measures higher than they have ever beenfor example a very basic measure of capital going back around  years was a simple ratio of equity to assetsin the last six years it’s back to high numbers not seen since the late s • highly liquid assets held by banks prob ably are much higher than ever before • many exotic and complex products are gone • many standardized derivatives are moving to clearinghouses • both consumer and commercial loans are underwritten to better standards than before the crisis • transparency to investors is far higher • boards and regulators are far more engaged   ivsolid strategy and future outlook but many things will be different — for example there will be far more risk residing in the central clearinghouses and nonbank competitors will have become bigger lenders in the marketplace clearinghouses will be the repository of far more risk than they were in the last crisis because more derivatives will be cleared in central clearinghousesit is important to remember that clearinghouses consoli date – but don’t necessarily eliminate – riskthat risk however is mitigated by proper margining and collateralwe have long main tained that it is important to stress test central clearinghouses in a similar way that banks are stress tested to make sure the central clear inghouses’ capital and resources are sufficient for a highly stressed environmentclearing houses are a good thing but not if they are a point of failure in the next crisisnonbank competitors are increasingly beginning to do basic lending in consumer small business and middle marketin middle market syndicated lending their share recently has increased from  a few years ago to  today and many people esti mate that it will continue to increase over the years to comethere is nothing wrong with having competitors including non bank competitorshowever they will act differently from banks in the next stressed environmenti will write about this later in this section when we go through a thought exercise of the next crisisthere already is far less liquidity in the general marketplace why this is important to issuers and investors liquidity in the marketplace is of value to both issuers of securities and investors in securitiesfor issuers it reduces their cost of issuance and for investors it reduces their cost when they buy or sellliquidity can be even more important in a stressed time because investors need to sell quickly and without liquidity prices can gap fear can grow and illiquidity can quickly spread – even in supposedly the most liquid marketssome investors take comfort in the fact that spreads ie the price between bid and ask have remained rather low and healthybut market depth is far lower than it was and we believe that is a precursor of liquidityfor example the market depth of year trea suries defined as the average size of the best three bids and offers today is  million down from  million at its peak inthe likely explanation for the lower depth in almost all bond markets is that inventories of marketmakers’ positions are dramati cally lower than in the pastfor instance the total inventory of treasuries readily avail able to marketmakers today is  trillion down from  trillion at its peak inmeanwhile the treasury market is  tril lion it was  trillion inthe trend in dealer positions of corporate bonds is similardealer positions in corporate securi ties are down by about  from their  peak while the amount of corporate bonds outstanding has grown by  since theninventories are lower – not because of one new rule but because of the multiple new rules that affect marketmaking including far higher capital and liquidity requirements and the pending implementation of the volcker rulethere are other potential rules which also may be adding to this phenomenonfor example posttrade transparency makes it harder to do sizable trades since the whole world will know one’s position in short orderrecent activity in the treasury markets and the currency markets is a warning shot across the bow treasury markets were quite turbulent in the spring and summer of  when the fed hinted that it soon would slow its asset purchasesthen on one day october   treasury securities moved  basis points statistically  to  standard deviations – an unprecedented move – an event that is supposed to happen only once in every  billion years or so the treasury market has only been around for  years or so – of course this should make you question statis tics to begin withsome currencies recently have had similar large movesimportantly treasuries and major country currencies are considered the most standardized and liquid financial instruments in the world   ivsolid strategy and future outlook the good news is that almost no one was significantly hurt by this which does show good resilience in the systembut this happened in what we still would consider a fairly benign environmentif it were to happen in a stressed environment it could have far worse consequencessome things never change — there will be another crisis and its impact will be felt by the financial markets the trigger to the next crisis will not be the same as the trigger to the last one – but there will be another crisistriggering events could be geopolitical the  middle east crisis a recession where the fed rapidly increases interest rates the  reces sion a commodities price collapse oil in the late s the commercial real estate crisis in the early s the asian crisis in  socalled “bubbles” the  internet bubble and the  mortgagehousing bubble etcwhile the past crises had different roots you could spend a lot of time arguing the degree to which geopolitical economic or purely financial factors caused each crisis they generally had a strong effect across the financial marketswhile crises look different the anatomy of how they play out does have common threadswhen a crisis starts investors try to protect themselvesfirst they sell the assets they believe are at the root of the problemsecond they generally look to put more of their money in safe havens commonly selling riskier assets like credit and equities and buying safer assets by putting deposits in strong banks buying treasuries or purchasing very safe money market fundsoften at one point in a crisis investors can sell only less risky assets if they need to raise cash because virtually there may be no market for the riskier onesthese investors include individuals corporations mutual funds pension plans hedge funds – pretty much everyone – each individually doing the right thing for themselves but collectively creating the market disruption that we’ve witnessed beforethis is the “runonthemarket” phenomenon that you saw in the last crisisand now a thought exercise of what might be different in the next crisis it sometimes is productive to conduct a thought exercise – in effect trying to reenact a “run on the market” but in this case applying the new rules to see what effect they might haveeven though we must necessarily be prepared for a crisis at all times we hope a real crisis is many years down the roadand in the united states we would be entering the crisis with a banking system that is far stronger than in the past which on its own could reduce the probability and severity of the next crisiswe are not going to guess at the potential cause of the crisis but we will assume that as usual we will have the normal “runonthemarket” type of behavior by inves torsso let’s now turn to look at how a crisis might affect the markets in the new worldthe money markets deposits repos shortterm treasuries will behave differently in the next crisis • banks are required to hold liquid assets against  of potential cash outflows in a crisisliquid assets essentially are cash held at central banks treasuries and agency mortgagebacked securitiesoutflows are an estimate of how much cash would leave the bank in the first  days of a crisisthis would include things like deposit outflows depending on the type of deposit and revolver take downs depending primarily on the type of borrowerin my opinion banks and their board of directors will be very reluc tant to allow a liquidity coverage ratio below  – even if the regulators say it is okayand in particular no bank will want to be the first institution to report a liquidity coverage ratio below  for fear of looking weak • in a crisis weak banks lose deposits while strong banks usually gain themin  jpmorganchase’s deposits went up more than  billionit is unlikely that we would want to accept new deposits the next time around because they would be considered nonoperating deposits short term in nature and would require valu able capital under both the supplementary leverage ratio and gsib   ivsolid strategy and future outlook • in a crisis everyone rushes into trea suries to protect themselvesin the last crisis many investors sold risky assets and added more than  trillion to their ownership of treasuries by buying treasuries or government money market fundsthis will be even more true in the next crisisbut it seems to us that there is a greatly reduced supply of treasuries to go around – in effect there may be a shortage of all forms of good collateralcurrently  trillion of treasuries are outstanding but according to our esti mates less than half of this amount is effectively free to be soldapproximately  trillion is accounted for by foreign exchange reserve holdings for foreign countries that have a strong desire to hold treasuries in order to manage their currenciesthe federal reserve owns  trillion in treasuries which it has said it will not sell for now and banks hold  trillion which for the most part they are required to hold due to liquidity require mentsmany people point out that the banks now hold  trillion in “excess” reserves at the federal reserve jpmorganchase alone has more than  billion at the fedbut in the new world these reserves are not “excess” sources of liquidity at all as they are required to maintain a bank’s liquidity coverage ratioin a crisis if banks turn away deposits most investors will have other options which includebuying treasuries directlybuying money market funds which own treasuriesbuying repos which are collateralized by treasuriesinvesting directly at the fed for a limited set of investors government sponsored enterprises money fundspurchasing credit instruments like commercial paperbuyers of credit loans secured loans underwriting and investments will be more reluctant to extend credit • in the crisis many banks lent against various forms of good collateral but not necessarily the highest quality collateral to help clients create liquidity and navi gate through the crisisthe collateral often came with significant haircuts and was of the type that banks thought they easily could riskmanage and for the most part they didin the last crisis jpmorganchase did tens of billions of this type of lendingin the next crisis banks will have a hard time increasing this type of credit because it will require capital and more liquidity • in a crisis clients also draw down revolvers for jpmorganchase alone this peaked at approximately  billion at one point in  – sometimes because they want to be conservative and have cash on hand and sometimes because they need the moneyas clients draw down revolvers riskweighted assets go up as will the capital needed to support the revolverin addition under the advanced basel rules we calculate that capital requirements can go up more than  because in a crisis assets are calculated to be even riskierthis certainly is very procyclical and would force banks to hoard capital • in addition banks may have a decrease in capital because new regulatory capital rules require losses on investment secu rities to reduce regulatory capitalthis would be particularly true if interest rates were rising in the next crisis which cannot be ruled out typically treasury yields drop dramatically in a crisis and that possibly could happen in this case too especially as they would be in short supplybut again one cannot rely on this • in the last crisis some healthy banks used their investment portfolios to buy and hold securities or loansin the next crisis banks will not be able to do that because buying most types of securities or loans would increase their rwa and reduce their liquidity   ivsolid strategy and future outlook • in the last crisis banks underwrote for other banks  billion of stock issu ance through rights offeringsbanks might be reluctant to do this again because it utilizes precious capital and requires more liquidity • it is my belief that in a crisis environ ment nonbank lenders will not continue rolling over loans or extending new credit except at exorbitant prices that take advantage of the crisis situationon the other hand banks continued to lend at fair prices in the last crisis because of the longterm and total relationship involvedbanks knew they had to lend freely because effectively they are the “lender of last resort” to their clients as the federal reserve is to the banksthis is a critical point jpmorganchase and most other banks understood their vital role in actively lending to clientsin  and  jpmorganchase rolled over more than  billion of loans and credit facili ties to small businesses middle market companies and large companies in addition to  billion for states and municipalities hospitals and nonprofitswe rolled over these capital and lending commitments to support our clients and always maintained fair and not rapacious pricing reflecting our longterm relationship with themthe markets in general could be more volatile — this could lead to a more rapid reduction of valuations the items mentioned above low inventory reluctance to extend credit etc make it more likely that a crisis will cause more volatile market movements with a rapid decline in valuations even in what are very liquid marketsit will be harder for banks either as lenders or marketmakers to “stand against the tide” but the american financial markets and more important the american economy generally have been extraordinarily resilient banks may be less able to act positively in the next crisis but they also are far stronger and unlikely in our opinion to create the next crisismany other actors in the financial system from hedge funds to longterm inves tors including corporations and large money managers will at some point step in and buy assetsthe government of course always is able to step in and play an important rolein addition regulators can improve the liquidity rules to allow banks to provide liquidity on a more “graduated” basis against more types of assets and give more flexibility on the “margin” than is requiredthat is they can give themselves both gas and brakes ie change liquidity rules to fit the environmentin addition we should try to eliminate procy clical rules which can exacerbate a crisisfundamentally as long as the economy is not collapsing financial markets generally recoverwhatever the turn of events jpmorganchase will have the capability to play its role in supporting clients and communities in the countries in which we operate   vwe want to be a standardbearer in the industry when it comes to meeting the heightened standards demanded by our regu lators – and not just because it’s required but because we think it’s the right thing to do for our shareholders clients employees and communitiesand we want to do this across all measures – from our controls to board governance the cultivating of a strong culture and how we are fighting cyber attacks to how we treat our clientsit starts at the top – with the board of directorsyour board is fully engaged in all critical matters the entire board is fully engaged in the affairs of the companyboard members are fully engaged in the company from setting the agenda of the board meetings to reviewing strategy and demanding strong controls to determining ceo compensation and succession planningboard members also are increasingly engaged in regulatory and shareholder affairsseveral of the board members meet regularly with our key regulators and major shareholdersmanagement succession planning is a priority of the boardregarding succession planning the board always must be prepared for the “hitbythebus” scenario which of course is not my preference but ongoing succes sion planning for the medium and long term is the highest priority of the boardimpor tantly our board members have complete access to and relationships with the key senior people and continually interact with them both formally and informallyboth the board members and i believe that under all scenarios this company has several capable potential successorsthe full board meets without the ceo at every board meetinggoing way back to bank one’s board more than a decade ago and before it was mandated the board would meet without the ceo that’s me because we all thought it was best for board members to have an open conversation about the ceo and the company without feeling any pres surethe board continues that practice todaynew rules mandate that directors meet at least once a year without the ceo – yet our board does so at every board meeting ie eight times a yearand usually at the end of the session the lead director comes to see me to give feedback and guidance about what the board is thinking and what it wantswe have a strong corporate culture — but we must continuously strengthen it jpmorganchase has served its shareholders customers and communities with distinc tion for more than  yearssince we were founded our company has been guided by a simple principle that perhaps was best artic ulated by jpmorgan jr in  when he said “i should state that at all times the idea of doing only firstclass business and that in a firstclass way has been before our minds” we continue to strive to meet that principleacknowledging mistakes — and learning from them — is part of the fabric of this companywe also recognize that we have made a number of mistakes – some of them quite painful and costly – over the last several yearsone of the things we learned was that we needed to redouble our efforts around culture – not reinvent our culture but recommit to it and ensure that it is an enduring strength of this institutionwhile we have done an extensive amount of work over the past year and a half to make sure we get this right we know that it can’t be a onetime effortit’s like keeping physically fit – you can’t get in shape and expect to stay that way if you stop exercisingwe have a fully engaged board an exceptional management team and a strong corporate culture   va strong corporate culture our efforts around culture and conduct are substantial and include the following we will continuously reinforce our business principlesback in july  at the close of the jpmorganchase and bank one merger we sent a small blue book to all employees outlining the capabilities of the combined firm as well as our mission and business principleswhile much has changed over the past decade our commitment to these principles remains the samein july  we marked the year anniversary of jpmorganchase and bank one coming together to form this exceptional companyit was fitting that on this special occasion we rededicated ourselves to those same business principles by distributing the rearticulated business principles on how we do business to every person in the companythese core princi ples which are written in plain english and include lots of specific examples describe how we want to conduct business and they will continue to guide us as we move forwardwhat we are doing differently today is that we are taking substantial actions to continu ously inculcate our employees and our leader ship on these principles • we want to make the how we do busi ness principles part of every major conver sation at the company – from the hiring onboarding and training of new recruits to town halls and management meetings • we conduct a substantial amount of ongoing training and certification from the code of conduct for all employees to the code of ethics for finance profes sionals that applies to the ceo chief financial officer controller and all profes sionals of the firm worldwide serving in a finance accounting corporate treasury tax or investor relations role • we have enhanced our leadership trainingwe have thousands of educa tional programs and we have consistently trained the top several hundred people on leadershipbut we did not train people when they became firsttime managers or importantly managers of managersthis will be another opportunity to drive home our how we do business principlesthe heart of this training provides the chance to teach our leadership how to do the right thing – not the easy thing – and to continually reinforce the principle of treating others in the way you would like to be treated • we also developed a pilot program within our corporate  investment bank in europe the middle east and africa on how we do business which includes focus groups and other efforts to analyze cultural themes and address any concerns around conduct and behaviorthis year we have taken the learnings from that pilot and will be rolling them out in a global firmwide culture and conduct programthese initiatives will make us a better companywe hope they will reduce any bad behaviorno human endeavor can ever be perfect but we are hopeful that as incidences of bad behavior decline and as management’s responses to bad behavior are vigorous governments and regulators will appreciate the intensity of our effortscompensation has been consistent and fair and is awarded with proper payfor performance our longterm success depends on the talents of our employeesand our firm’s compensa tion system plays a significant role in our ability to attract retain and motivate the highest quality workforcewe design our compensation program to encompass best practices support our business objectives and enhance shareholder valuefor example • we do not have changeofcontrol agree ments special executive retirement plans golden parachutes or things like special severance packages for senior executives • we do not pay bonuses for completing a merger which we regard as part of the job when a merger has proved successful compensation might go up   va strong corporate culture • we virtually have no private “deals” or multiyear contracts for senior management • we always have looked at financial perfor mance as a critical factor but not the only factor in payforperformancewe have formulas which always have been prop erly charged for capital usage for how we accrue compensation but we do not pay it out in a formulaic way to anyonefinan cial performance alone is not a compre hensive picture of performancebroader contributions are important like qualita tive skills such as leadership attributes character and integrity and management abilitythis also includes recruiting coaching and training building better systems and fostering innovation just to name a few • we also have invoked comprehensive clawbacks of previously granted awards andor repayment of previously vested awards when we thought it was appro priatein  alone more than  employees had compensation reduced for risk and controlrelated eventsimpor tantly many more than that were termi nated for poor performance or ethical lapses during the course of the yearcompensation alone is not enough and one should not confuse good compensation with good moralegetting compensation right is crit ical – everyone wants to feel they are being paid fairly and most people have other alternativesbut proper compensation alone is not enoughi have seen many companies try to make up for politics bureaucracy and low morale with high compensation – it does not workwhen a company has been doing poorly or treats its customers badly the company should expect low moralewhat employees want to see is that the company faces its issues reduces politics and bureaucracy and improves customer service and satisfactionmaintaining a corporate culture where the right people are promoted and everyone is treated with respect is as important as compensationthen morale will improve and employees will be proud of where they work every daywe need to operate like a partnershipif for example a company’s largest and perhaps most important business unit is under enormous stress and strain unlikely to earn money regardless of who is in charge a manager might ask his or her best leader to take on the job of running that businessthis may be the toughest job in the company one that will take years to work through before the ship has been rightedwhen the manager asks a leader to take on the respon sibility she quite appropriately will want to know whether she will be supported in the toughest of times “will you make sure the organization doesn’t desert me” “will you stop the politics of people using my unit’s poor performance against me” “will you compensate me fairly” my answer to these questions would be yesand as long as i thought she was doing the job well i would want to pay her like our best leaders profits asideconversely we all know that a rising tide lifts all boatswhen that’s the case paying that leader too much possibly is the worst thing one can do – because it teaches people the wrong lessonwe still believe deeply in share ownershipwe would like all our senior managers to have a large portion of their net worth in the companywe believe this fosters partner shipwhile some make the argument that it causes excessive risk taking – we disagreethe first people to lose all of their money if a company fails are the shareholders and the management teamwe want your manage ment team to be good stewards of your capital and to treat it as they would their ownit is formulaic compensation plans where people are paid solely on financial performance that can cause undue risky and bad behaviorthe entire operating committee gets involved in compensation — it is not done in a back roomone way we make sure we are fair and just with compensation is that the entire operating committee spends a substantial amount of time reviewing the compensation of our top  people – this way we have   va strong corporate culture internal justice we can review someone’s total performance across all measures and we can understand how a manager manages up down and across the organiza tion – not just upwe want to have the best people and competi tive compensation is criticalwe must continue to pay our people properly competitively and well for doing a good jobit is imperative at jpmorganchase that we continue to attract and retain the bestwe treat all of our people fairlywhile we generally talk about compensation for the most senior managers the compensation levels of our entire employee population are fairly similar to that of the us popula tion’s household income distributionwe invest a significant amount of time and money to ensure that all of our employees are properly compensatedwe still have a defined benefit pension plan for most of our employees that provides a fixed income upon retirement to supplement social security and any other savings they havewe also provide a k plan with matching dollarsin addition we have excel lent healthcare plans that incentivize people to take care of themselvesfor example premiums are lower if an employee gets an annual physical examination or stops smokingwe also subsidize these health care plans more for lower paid employees at  versus our higher paid employees who are atand each year we are recognized as a great place to work by various groups including working mother  best companies top  military friendly employers by gijobs magazine and best employers for healthy lifestyles by the national business group on health among many othersas we centralize all risk functions we also must be certain that line of business ceos remain empowered to manage their business end to end we always have tried to be very thoughtful about which functions are centralized or decentralized at the companywe always have centralized functions that can create huge economies of scale like data centers or utilities that are used by the entire company like general ledgers and payroll or critical control functions like corporate legal firmwide accounting policies etcwe try to decentralize where we can and when it makes sense to do sofor example while a lot of finance functions reside at corpo rate like accounting policy some finance people are devoted to only one line of business so we keep them within that line of businesswe do this to provide direct accountability speed up decision making and minimize bureaucracyin the new world in order to improve the consistency of controls regulators have demanded that most risk and control func tions be centralized including risk compli ance finance oversight  control audit and legalin doing this we have given huge amounts of additional authority to functions at our corporate headquarterscorporate headquarters can sometimes forget that it exists only because there is a banker in front of a client somewherethe home depot one of america’s great companies does not call its corporate headquarters the corporate head quarters – it’s called store support center to remind employees every day why they are there to support the stores and the clientsthis still remains true at jpmorganchase – we at corporate would not be here if we didn’t have our bankers in front of clientswe need to work hard to get the best of both centralization and decentralizationand we need to manage corporate so the line of busi ness ceos and management teams are fully responsible and empowered to manage their businessescentralization should not mean demoralizing bureaucracy or slowing down services as multiple committees and layers   va strong corporate culture sign off on every decision and stifle innova tionwe have been managing through this process with our eyes wide openthe oper ating committee members of the company spend a considerable amount of time to make sure we get this rightwe need to develop the right culture and avoid creating a culture of fingerpointingwe need to analyze our mistakes because that is the only way we can fix them and consis tently improvebut we cannot allow this to devolve into crippling bureaucratic activity or create a culture of backstabbing and blamewe need to develop a safe environ ment where people can raise issues and admit and analyze mistakes without fear of retributionwe must treat people properly and respectfully – even if we have to make tough decisionsi believe this company currently has the best management team with whom i have ever been associated – and i mean their character culture and capabilitiesi now ask questions that i did not ask when i was a younger manager “would i want to work for these managers” “would i want my children to work for these managers” my answer would not always have been yes but now it isthese leaders have navigated the last several years with fortitude and a smile driving results making tough decisions and treating each other as complete partnersthey are the reason why both performance and morale remain strong in this environmentclosing comments jamie dimon chairman and chief executive officer april   i feel enormously fortunate to be part of the remarkable year journey of this exceptional companyi wish you all could see our employees and your management team at work particularly in these challenging timesif you did i know that you like me would be bursting with appreciation and pride and have great comfort in knowing that our wonderful legacy will continue

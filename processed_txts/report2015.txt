Dear Fellow Shareholders,
Last year — in fact, the last decade — was an extraordinary time for our company. We 
managed through the financial crisis and its turbulent aftermath while never losing 
sight of the reason we are here: to serve our clients, our communities and countries 
across the globe and, of course, to earn a fair profit for our shareholders. All the 
while, we have been successfully executing our control and regulatory agenda and 
continuing to invest in technology, infrastructure and talent — critical to the future of 
the company. And each year, our company has been getting safer and stronger. We 
continue to see exciting opportunities to invest for the future and to do more for our 
clients and our communities — as well as continue to support the growth of economies 
around the world. 
I feel enormously blessed to work for this great company and with such talented 
employees. Our management team and employees have built an exceptional 
organization that is one of the most trusted and respected financial institutions in the 
world. It has been their dedication, fortitude and perseverance that made this possible. 
And it fills me with tremendous pride.
Jamie Dimon,  
Chairman and  
Chief Executive Officer

Our company earned a record $24.4 billion in net income on revenue of $96.6 billion 
in 2015. In fact, we have delivered record results in the last five out of six years, and 
we hope to continue to deliver in the future. Our financial results reflected strong 
underlying performance across our businesses, and, importantly, we exceeded all our 
major financial commitments — balance sheet optimization, capital deployment, global 
systemically important bank (GSIB) surcharge reduction and expense cuts. 
Earnings, Diluted Earnings per Share and Return on Tangible Common Equity 
2004—2015 
($ in billions, except per share and ratio data) 
While we did produce record profits last year, our returns on tangible common equity  
have been coming down, mostly due to higher capital requirements, higher control  
costs and low interest rates. Our return on tangible common equity was 13% last 
year, though we still believe that we will be able to achieve, over time, returns of 
approximately 15%. We still don’t know the final capital rules, which could have 
additional negative effects, but we do believe that the capital requirements eventually 
will be offset by optimizing our use of capital and other precious resources, by realizing 
market share gains due to some competitors leaving certain businesses, and by 
implementing extensive cost efficiencies created by streamlining and digitizing our 
processes. I will discuss some of these efforts later on in this letter.

We continued to deliver for our shareholders in 2015. The table above shows the 
growth in tangible book value per share, which we believe is a conservative measure 
of value. You can see that our tangible book value per share has grown far more than 
that of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500) in both time periods. For Bank 
One shareholders since March 27, 2000, the stock has performed far better than most 
financial companies and the S&P 500. We are not proud of the fact that our stock 
performance has only equaled the S&P 500 since the JPMorgan Chase & Co. merger 
with Bank One on July 1, 2004 and essentially over the last five to 10 years. On a 
relative basis, though, JPMorgan Chase stock has far outperformed the S&P Financials 
Index and, in fact, has been one of the best performers of all banks during this difficult 
period. The details are shown on the table on the following page.

Tangible book value over time captures the company’s use of capital, balance sheet and profitability. In this chart, we are looking at 
heritage Bank One shareholders and JPMorgan Chase & Co. shareholders. The chart shows the increase in tangible book value per share; 
it is an aftertax number assuming all dividends were retained vs. the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500), which is a pre-tax number 
with dividends reinvested.

Many of the legal and regulatory issues that our company and the industry have faced 
since the Great Recession have been resolved or are receding, which will allow the 
strength and quality of our underlying business to more fully shine through.
In this letter, I will discuss the issues highlighted below — which describe many of 
our successes and opportunities, as well as our challenges and responses. The main 
sections are listed below, and, unlike prior years, we have organized much of this 
letter around some of the key questions we have received from shareholders and other 
interested parties.

I. 
Our franchises are strong — and getting stronger 
• How do you compare your franchises with your peers? What makes you believe your 
businesses are strong? 
 
II. We must and will protect our company and those we serve
• You say you have a “fortress balance sheet.” What does that mean? Can you handle 
the extreme stress that seems to happen around the world from time to time? 
• Have you completed your major de-risking initiatives? 
• Do you think you now have “fortress controls” in place?
• To protect the company and to meet standards of safety and soundness, don’t you 
have to earn a fair profit? Many banks say that the cost of all the new rules makes 
this hard to do. 
• What is all this talk of regulatory optimization, and don’t some of these things  
hurt clients? When will you know the final rules?
• How do you manage geopolitical and country risks?
• How do you manage your interest rate exposure? Are you worried about negative 
interest rates and the growing differences across countries?
• Are you worried about liquidity in the marketplace? What does it mean for  
JPMorgan Chase, its clients and the broader economy?
• Why are you making such a big deal about protecting customers’ data in your bank? 
 
III. We actively develop and support our employees
• How are you ensuring you have the right conduct and culture?
• How are you doing in your diversity efforts?
• With all the new rules, committees and centralization, how can you fight bureaucracy 
and complacency and keep morale high?
• How are you doing retaining key people?

IV. We are here to serve our clients
• How do you view innovation, technology and FinTech? And have 
banks been good innovators? Do you have economies of scale, and 
how are they benefiting your clients?
• How do you intend to win in payments, particularly with so many 
strong competitors — many from Silicon Valley? 
• You always seem to be segmenting your businesses — how and why 
are you doing this?
• How and why do you use big data?
• Why are you investing in sales and trading, as well as in your 
Investment Bank, when others seem to be cutting back?
• Why are you still in the mortgage business? 
 
V. 
We have always supported our communities
• You seem to be doing more and more to support your communities 
— how and why? 
 
VI. A safe, strong banking industry is absolutely critical to a country’s 
success — banks’ roles have changed, but they will never be a utility
• Does the United States really need large banks?
• Why do you say that banks need to be steadfast and always there for 
their clients — doesn’t that always put you in the middle of the storm?
• Will banks ever regain a position of trust? How will this be done?
• Are you and your regulators thinking more comprehensively and 
in a forward-looking way to play a role in helping to accelerate 
global growth? 
 
VII. Good public policy is critically important
• Are you worried about bad public policy?

When I travel around the world, and we do 
business in over 100 countries, our clients – 
who are big companies to small businesses, 
investors and individuals, as well as coun-
tries and their sovereign institutions – are 
almost uniformly pleased with us. In fact, 
most cities, states and countries want more 
of JPMorgan Chase. They want us to bring 
more of our resources – our financial capa-
bilities and technology, as well as our human 
capital and expertise – to their communities. 
While we do not know what the next few 
years may bring, we are confident that the 
needs of our clients around the world will 
continue to grow and that our consistent 
strategy of building for the future and being 
there for our clients in good times and bad 
has put us in very good stead. Whatever the 
future brings, we will face it from a position 
of strength and stability.
Because our business leaders do such a 
good job describing their businesses (and 
I strongly urge you to read their letters on 
pages 52–72 in this Annual Report), it is 
unnecessary for me to cover each in detail 
here, other than to answer the following 
critical questions.

1  Excludes legal expense.
2  Best-in-class overhead ratio represents implied expenses of comparable peer segments weighted by JPMorgan Chase (JPM) revenue: Wells Fargo 
Community Banking (WFC), Citi Institutional Clients Group (Citi), PNC Corporate and Institutional Banking (PNC), UBS Wealth Management and  
Wealth Management Americas (UBS WM) and BlackRock (BLK). JPM overhead ratio represents the sum of the implied expenses of all peers and  
JPM Corporate segment divided by JPM revenue.
3  CIB ROE excluding legal expense was 14%.
4  Represents firmwide ROTCE for JPM. Goodwill is primarily related to the Bank One merger and prior acquisitions and is predominantly retained  
by Corporate. 
5  Best-in-class ROTCE represents implied net income minus preferred stock dividends (NIAC) for each comparable LOB peer weighted by JPM average 
tangible common equity: WFC, Citi Institutional Clients Group (Citi), Fifth Third Bank (FITB), Bank of America Global Wealth and Investment Manage-
ment (BAC), T. Rowe Price (TROW). JPM ROTCE represents the sum of the implied combined NIAC of all peers and JPM Corporate segment divided by 
JPM average tangible equity. 
JPMorgan Chase is in Line with Best-in-Class Peers in Both Efficiency and Returns

Virtually all of our businesses are close to 
best in class, in overhead ratios and, more 
important, in return on equity (ROE), as 
shown on the chart on page 8. Of even more 
relevance, we have these strong ratios while 
making sizable investments for the future 
(which we have reported on extensively in 
the past and you can read more about in the 
CEO letters). It is easy to meet short-term 
targets by skimping on investments for 
the future, but that is not our approach for 
building the business for the long term. 
How do you compare your franchises with your peers? What makes you believe your businesses 
are strong?
We are deeply aware that our clients 
choose who they want to do business with 
each and every day, and we are gratified 
that we continue to earn our clients’ busi-
ness and their trust. If you are gaining 
customers and market share, you have to 
be doing something right. The chart below 
shows that we have been meeting this goal 
fairly consistently for 10 years.

Improved Consumer Satisfaction: 2010—2015 
Good businesses also deeply care about 
improving customer satisfaction. As shown 
above, you can see that our Chase customer 
satisfaction score continues to rise. In 
addition, our Commercial Banking satis-
faction score is among the highest in the 
industry in terms of customer loyalty. In 
Asset Management, where customers vote 
with their wallet, JPMorgan Funds finished 
second in long-term net flows among all 
fund complexes. 
Later on in this letter, I will describe our 
fortress balance sheet and controls, as 
well as the discipline we have around risk 
management. I will also talk more about 
our employees, some exciting new oppor-
tunities – mostly driven by innovative 
technologies – and our ongoing support 
for our communities and our country. It is 
critical that we do all of these things right 
to maintain the strength of our company.

In support of our main mission – to serve 
our clients and our communities – there 
is nothing more important than to protect 
our company so that we are strong and can 
continue to be here for all of those who 
count on us. We have taken many actions 
that should give our shareholders, clients and 
regulators comfort and demonstrate that our 
company is rock solid.
The actions we have taken to strengthen  
our company.
In this section, we describe the many 
actions that we have taken to make our 
company stronger and safer: our fortress 
balance sheet with enhanced capital and 
liquidity, our ability to survive extreme 
stress of multiple types, our extensive 
de-risking and simplification of the busi-
ness, and the building of fortress controls in 
meeting far more stringent regulatory stan-
dards. Taken together, these actions have 
enabled us to make extraordinary progress 
toward reducing and ultimately eliminating 
the risk of JPMorgan Chase failing and  
the cost of any failure being borne by the  
American taxpayer or the U.S. economy. 
II.
WE MUST AND WILL PROTECT OUR COMPANY AND 
THOSE WE SERVE
You say you have a “fortress balance sheet.” What does that mean? Can you handle the 
extreme stress that seems to happen around the world from time to time?
Nearly every year since the Great Recession, 
we have improved virtually every measure of 
financial strength, including many new ones. 
It’s important to note as a starting point that 
in the worst years of 2008 and 2009, JPMorgan 
Chase did absolutely fine – we never lost 
money, we continued to serve our clients, 
and we had the wherewithal and capability 
to buy and integrate Bear Stearns and 
Washington Mutual. That said, we none-
theless recognize that many Americans did 
not do fine, and the financial crisis exposed 
weaknesses in the mortgage market and 
other areas. Later in this letter, I will also 
describe what we are doing to strengthen 
JPMorgan Chase and to help support the 
entire economy. 
The chart on page 12 shows many of the 
measures of our financial strength – both 
from the year preceding the crisis and our 
improvement in the last year alone. 
In addition, every year, the Federal Reserve puts 
all large banks through a very severe and very 
detailed stress test.
Among other things, last year’s stress test 
assumed that unemployment would go to 
10.1%, housing prices would fall 25%, equity 
markets would decline by nearly 60%, real 
gross domestic product (GDP) would decline 
4.6%, credit spreads would widen dramati-
cally and oil prices would rise to $110 per 
barrel. The stress test also assumed an instan-
taneous global market shock, effectively far 
worse than the one that happened in 2009, 
causing large trading losses. It also assumed 
the failure of the largest counterparty (this 
is meant to capture the failure of the global 
bank that you have the most extensive deriva-
tive relationship with; e.g., a Lehman-type 
event), which would cause additional losses. 
The stress test assumed that banks would not 
stop buying back stock – therefore depleting 
their capital – and would continue to grow 
dramatically. (Of course, growing dramati-
cally and buying back stock if your bank were 
under stress would be irresponsible – and is 
something we would never do.) Under this 
assumed stress, the Federal Reserve esti-
mates that JPMorgan Chase would lose  
* Footnote: Our Chief Operating 
Officer Matt Zames talks in his 
letter on pages 52–55 about 
many important initiatives to 
protect our company, including 
our physical security and 
cybersecurity, so I will not 
duplicate any of that information.

$55 billion pre-tax over a nine-quarter 
period, an amount that we would easily 
manage because of the strength of our 
capital base. Remember, the Federal Reserve 
stress test is not a forecast – it appropriately 
assumes multiple levels of conservatism 
and that very little mitigating action can be 
taken. However, we believe that if the stress 
scenario actually happened, we would incur 
minimal losses over a cumulative nine-
quarter period because of the extensive miti-
gating actions that we would take. It bears 
repeating that in the actual Great Recession, 
which was not unlike last year’s stress test, 
JPMorgan Chase never lost money in any 
quarter and was quite profitable over the 
nine-quarter period.
The stress test is extremely severe on credit.
The 2015 Comprehensive Capital Analysis 
and Review (CCAR), or stress test, projected 
credit losses over a nine-quarter period 
that totaled approximately $50 billion for 
JPMorgan Chase, or 6.4% of all our loans. 
This is higher than what the actual cumula-

tive credit losses were for all banks during 
the Great Recession (they were 5.6%), and 
our credit book today is materially better 
than what we had at that time. The 2015 
CCAR losses were even with the actual losses 
for banks during the worst two years of the 
Great Depression in the 1930s (6.4%). 
The stress test is extremely severe on trading and 
counterparty risk.
Our 2015 CCAR trading and counterparty 
losses were $24 billion. We have two compar-
isons that should give comfort that our losses 
would never be this large.
First, recall what actually happened to us in 
2008. In the worst quarter of 2008, we lost 
$1.7 billion; for the entire year, we made $6.3 
billion in trading revenue in the Investment 
Bank, which included some modest losses 
on the Lehman default (one of our largest 
counterparties). The trading books are much 
more conservative today than they were in 
2008, and at that time, we were still paying 
a considerable cost for assimilating and 
de-risking Bear Stearns.
Second, we run hundreds of stress tests 
of our own each week, across our global 
trading operations, to ensure our ability 
to withstand and survive many bad and 
extreme scenarios. These scenarios include 
events such as what happened in 2008, other 
historically damaging events and also new 
situations that might occur. We manage 
our company so that even under the worst 
market stress test conditions, we would 
almost never bear a loss of more than $5 
billion (remember, we earn approximately 
$10 billion pre-tax, pre-provision each 
quarter). We recognize that on rare occa-
sions, we could experience a negative signifi-
cant event that could lead to our having a 
poor quarter. But we will be vigilant and will 
never take such a high degree of risk that it 
jeopardizes the health of our company and 
our ability to continue to serve our clients. 
This is a bedrock principle. Later in this 
letter, I will also describe how we think about 
idiosyncratic geopolitical risk. 
And the capital we have to bear losses is 
enormous.
We have an extraordinary amount of capital 
to sustain us in the event of losses. It is 
instructive to compare assumed extreme 
losses against how much capital we have for 
this purpose.
You can see in the table below that JPMorgan 
Chase alone has enough loss absorbing 
resources to bear all the losses, assumed by 
CCAR, of the 31 largest banks in the United 
States. Because of regulations and higher 
capital, large banks in the United States are 
far stronger. And even if any one bank might 
fail, in my opinion, there is virtually no 
chance of a domino effect. Our shareholders 
should understand that while large banks do 
significant business with each other, they do 
not directly extend much credit to one other. 
And when they trade derivatives, they mark-
to-market and post collateral to each other 
every day.

Do you think you now have “fortress controls” in place? 
We are good and are getting better. The 
intense efforts over the last few years across 
our operating businesses – Risk, Finance, 
Compliance, Legal and Audit – are now 
yielding real results that will protect the 
company in the future. We have reinforced 
a culture of accountability for assuming risk 
and have come a long way in self-identifying 
and fixing shortcomings. Many new perma-
nent organizational structures have been 
put in place to ensure constant review and 
continuous improvement. For example, 
we now have a permanent Oversight & 
Control Group. The group is charged with 
enhancing the firm’s control environment 
by looking within and across the lines of 
business and corporate functions to identify 
and remediate control issues. This func-
tion enables us to detect control problems 
more quickly, escalate issues promptly and 
engage other stakeholders to understand 
However, we are going to be extremely vigi-
lant to do more de-risking if we believe that 
something creates additional legal, regulatory 
or political risks. We regularly review all our 
business activities and try to exceed – not 
just meet – regulatory demands. We also now 
ask our Legal Department to be on the search 
for “emerging legal risks.” We try to think 
differently; for example, we try to look at 
legal risks not based on how the law is today 
but based on how the law might be inter-
preted differently 10 years from now. It is 
perfectly reasonable for the legal and regula-
Have you completed your major de-risking initiatives? 
Yes, we have completed our major de-risking 
initiatives, and some were pretty draconian. 
In the chart below, I show just a few of the 
actions that we were willing to take to reduce 
various forms of risk:
tory agencies to want to improve the quality 
of the businesses they oversee, particularly 
around important issues such as customer 
protection. We also expect this refinement 
frequently will be achieved through enforce-
ment actions as opposed to the adoption of 
new rules that raise standards. For many 
years, regulations generally were viewed as 
being static. As we do everywhere else, we 
should be striving for constant improvement 
to stay ahead of the curve.

common themes across the firm. We have 
strengthened the Audit Department and risk 
assessment throughout the firm, enhanced 
data quality and controls, and also strength-
ened permanent standing committees that 
review new clients, new products and all 
reputational issues. 
The effort is enormous.
Since 2011, our total headcount directly asso-
ciated with Controls has gone from 24,000 
people to 43,000 people, and our total annual 
Controls spend has gone from $6 billion to 
approximately $9 billion annually over that 
same time period. We have more work to 
do, but a strong and permanent foundation 
is in place. Far more is spent on Controls if 
you include the time and effort expended 
by front-office personnel, committees and 
reviews, as well as certain technology and 
operations functions.
We have also made a very substantial amount 
of progress in Anti-Money Laundering/Bank 
Secrecy Act. 
We deployed a new anti-money laundering 
(AML) system, Mantas, which is a moni-
toring platform for all global payment 
transactions. It now is functioning across our 
company and utilizes sophisticated algo-
rithms that are regularly enhanced based on 
transactional experience. We review elec-
tronically $105 trillion of gross payments 
each month, and then, on average, 55,000 
transactions are reviewed by humans after 
algorithms identify any single transaction 
as a potential issue. Following this effort, 
we stopped doing business with 18,000 
customers in 2015. We also are required to 
file suspicious activity reports (SAR) with the 
government on any suspicious activity. Last 
year, we filed 180,000 SARs, and we estimate 
that the industry as a whole files millions 
each year. We understand how important  
this activity is, not just to protect our 
company but to help protect our country 
from criminals and terrorists. 
We exited or restricted approximately 500 
foreign correspondent banking relationships 
and tens of thousands of client relationships 
to simplify our business and to reduce our 
AML risk. The cost of doing proper AML/
KYC (Know Your Customer) diligence on a 
client increased dramatically, making many 
of these relationships immediately unprofit-
able. But we did not exit simply due to profit-
ability – we could have maintained unprofit-
able client relationships to be supportive of 
countries around the world that are allies to 
the United States. The real reason we exited 
was often because of the extraordinary legal 
risk if we were to make a mistake. In many of 
these places, it simply is impossible to meet 
the new requirements, and if you make just 
one mistake, the regulatory and legal conse-
quences can be severe and disproportionate.
We also remediated 130,000 accounts for 
KYC – across the Private Bank, Commercial 
Bank and the Corporate & Investment Bank. 
This exercise vastly improved our data, gave 
us far more information on our clients and 
also led to our exiting a small number of 
client relationships. We will be vigilant on 
onboarding and maintaining files on all new 
clients in order to stay as far away as we can 
from any client with unreasonable risk. 
In all cases, we carefully tried to get the balance 
right while treating customers fairly. 
You can see that we are doing everything in 
our power to meet and even exceed the spirit 
and the letter of the law to avoid making 
mistakes and the high cost – both monetarily 
and to our reputation – that comes with 
that. But we also tried to make sure that in 
our quest to eliminate risk, we did not ask 
a lot of good clients to exit. We hope that in 
the future, the regulatory response to any 
mistakes – if and when they happen, and 
they will happen – will take into account the 
extraordinary effort to get it right.

many of the processes we implemented for 
CCAR and AML/KYC had to be done quickly, 
and many were effectively handled outside 
our normal processes. Eventually, CCAR will 
be embedded into our normal forecasting 
and budgeting systems. And we are trying to 
build the data collection part of KYC into a 
utility that the entire industry can use – not 
just for us and our peer group but, equally 
important, for the client’s benefit (the client 
would essentially only have to fill out one 
form, which then could be used by all banks). 
In addition, throughout the company, contin-
ually creating straight-through processing, 
online client service and other initiatives 
will both improve the client experience and 
decrease our costs.
What is all this talk of regulatory optimization, and don’t some of these things hurt clients?  
When will you know the final rules?
In the last year, we took some dramatic 
actions to reduce our GSIB capital surcharge, 
which we now have successfully reduced 
from 4.5% to an estimate of 3.5%. These 
steps included reducing non-operating 
deposits by approximately $200 billion, level 
3 assets by $22 billion and notional deriva-
tives amounts by $15 trillion. We did this 
faster than we, or anyone, thought we could. 
We still will be working to further reduce the 
GSIB surcharge, but any reduction from this 
point will take a few years. 
Like us, most banks are modifying their 
business models and client relationships to 
accomplish their regulatory objectives. We 
are doing this by managing our constraints 
at the most granular level possible – by 
product, client or business. Clearly, some 
of these constraints, including GSIB and 
CCAR, cannot be fully pushed down to 
the client. Importantly, we are focused on 
client-friendly execution – and we recog-
nize that these constraints are of no direct 
concern to clients. 
To protect the company and to meet standards of safety and soundness, don’t you have to earn a 
fair profit? Many banks say that the cost of all the new rules makes this hard to do. 
Having enough capital and liquidity, and 
even the most solid fortress controls, doesn’t 
make you completely safe and sound. Deliv-
ering proper profit margins and maintaining 
profitability through a normal credit cycle 
also are important. A business does this by 
having the appropriate business mix, making 
good loans and managing expenses over time. 
Clearly, some of the new rules create 
expenses and burdens on our company. 
Some of these expenses will eventually be 
passed on to clients, but we have many ways 
to manage our expenses. Simplifying our 
business, streamlining our procedures, and 
automating and digitizing processes, some of 
which previously were being done effectively 
by hand, all will bring relief. For example, 
In the new world, our company has approxi-
mately 20 new or significantly enhanced 
balance sheet and liquidity-related regulatory 
requirements – the most critical ones are the 
GSIB capital surcharge, CCAR, the Liquidity 
Coverage Ratio, the Supplementary Leverage 
Ratio and Basel III capital. Banks must neces-
sarily optimize across these constraints to be 
able to meet all their regulatory requirements 
and, importantly, earn a profit. Every bank 
has a different binding constraint, and, over 
time, that constraint may change. Currently, 
our overriding constraint is the GSIB capital 
surcharge. Our shareholders should bear in 
mind that the U.S. government requires a 
GSIB capital surcharge that is double that 
of our international competitors. And this 
additional charge may ultimately put some 
U.S. banks at a disadvantage vs. international 
competitors. This is one reason why we 
worked so hard to reduce the GSIB capital 
surcharge – we do not want to be an outlier 
in the long run because of it. 
17
17
Unfortunately, some of the final rules around 
capital are still not fully known at this time. 
There are still several new rules coming that 
also could impact our company – probably 
the most important to us is how the GSIB 
capital surcharge is incorporated into the 
CCAR stress test. To date, we have managed 
to what we do know. We believe that when 
the final rules are made and known, we can 
adjust to them in an appropriate way. 
As banks change their business models to 
adapt to the new world, some are exiting 
certain products or regions. Market shares 
will change, and both products and product 
pricing will change over time. Therefore, we 
think there will be a lot of adjustments to 
make and tools to deploy so that we can still 
serve our clients and earn a fair profit. 
We operate in more than 100 countries 
across the globe – and we are constantly 
analyzing the geopolitical and country risks 
that we face. The reason we operate in all 
these countries is not simply because they 
represent new markets where we can sell 
our products. When we operate in a country, 
we serve not only local institutions (govern-
ments and sovereign institutions, banks and 
corporations in that country) but also some 
of those institutions and corporations outside 
their country, along with multinationals 
when they enter that country. This creates 
a huge network effect. In all the countries 
where we operate, approximately 40% of the 
business is indigenous, 30% is outbound and 
30% is inbound. All these institutions need 
financing and advice (M&A, equity, debt and 
loans), risk management (foreign exchange 
and interest rates) and asset management 
services (financial planning and investment 
management), as well as operating services 
(custody and cash management) in their 
own countries and globally. It takes decades 
to build these capabilities and relationships 
– we cannot go in and out of a country on a 
whim, based on a short-term feeling about 
risk in that country. Therefore, we need plans 
for the long term while carefully managing 
current risk.
We carefully monitor risks — country by country. 
For each country, we take a long-term view 
of its growth potential across all our lines 
of business. Each country is different, but, 
for the most part, emerging and developing 
markets will grow faster than developed 
countries. And as they grow, the need for 
our services grows dramatically. While we 
have a future growth plan for each country, 
we obviously can’t know with any certainty 
everything that will happen or the timing 
of recessions. No matter what the future 
brings, we make sure that we can easily 
bear the losses if we are wrong in our 
assessments. For each material country, 
we look at what our losses would be under 
severe stress (not that different from the 
Fed’s CCAR stress test). We manage so 
that should the extreme situation occur, 
we might lose money, but we could easily 
handle the result. Below are a few examples 
of how we manage risk while continuing to 
serve clients in specific countries.
China. We believe it likely that, in 20–25 years, 
China will be a developed nation, probably 
housing 25% or more of the top 3,000 compa-
nies globally. Going forward, we do not expect 
China to enjoy the smooth, steady growth it 
has had over the past 20 years. Reforming 
inefficient state-owned enterprises, developing 
healthy markets (like we have in the United 
States) with full transparency and creating a 
convertible currency where capital can move 
freely will not be easy. There will be many 
bumps in the road. We publicly disclose in 
our Form 10-K that we have approximately 
$19 billion of country exposure to China. We 
run China through a severe stress test (essen-
tially, a major recession with massive defaults 
and trading losses), and we estimate that our 
losses in this scenario could be approximately 
$4 billion. We do not expect this situation to 
How do you manage geopolitical and country risks?

happen, but if it did, we could easily handle 
it. We manage our growth in China to try to 
capture the long-term value (and, remember, 
this will help a lot of our businesses outside of 
China, too) and in a way that would enable us 
to handle bad, unexpected outcomes. We don’t 
mind having a bad quarter or two, but we will 
not risk our company on any country. This is 
how we manage in all countries in which we 
have material activity.
Brazil. Brazil has had a deteriorating 
economy, shrinking by 3%–4% over the last 
year. In addition, as I write this letter, Brazil 
faces political upheaval as its president is 
being threatened with impeachment and its 
former president is being indicted. Yet the 
country has a strong judicial system, many 
well-run companies, impressive universities, 
peaceful neighbors and an enormous quan-
tity of natural resources. In Brazil, we have 
banking relationships with more than 2,000 
clients, approximately 450 multinational 
corporations going into Brazil to do business 
and approximately 50 Brazilian companies 
going outbound. Our publicly disclosed expo-
sure to Brazil is approximately $11 billion, 
but we think that in extreme stress, we might 
lose $2 billion. In each of the last three years, 
we actually have made money in Brazil. We 
are not retreating – because the long-term 
prospects are probably fine – and for decades 
to come, Brazilians will appreciate our stead-
fastness when they most needed it. 
Argentina. Argentina is now a country 
with incredible opportunity. In the 1920s, 
its GDP per person was larger than that 
of France, whereas today, it is barely one-
third compared with France. Argentina is 
an example of terrible public policy, often 
adopted under the auspices of being good 
for the people, that has resulted in extraordi-
nary damage to the economy. However, the 
country has a highly educated population, a 
new president who is making bold and intel-
ligent moves, peaceful neighbors and, like 
Brazil, an abundance of natural resources. 
You might be surprised to know that for 
the past 10 years, in spite of the country’s 
difficulties, JPMorgan Chase has made a 
modest profit there by consistently serving 
our clients and the country. This year, we 
took a little additional risk in Argentina 
with a special financing to help bring the 
country some stability and help get it back 
into the global markets. We are hoping that 
Argentina can be an example to the world of 
what can happen when a country has a good 
leader who adopts good policy.
To give you more comfort, I want to remind 
you that throughout all the international 
crises over the last decade, we maintained 
our businesses in many places that were 
under stress – such as Spain, Italy, Greece, 
Egypt, Portugal and Ireland. In almost every 
case, we did not have any material prob-
lems, and we are able to navigate every 
issue and continue to serve all our clients. 
Again, we hope this will put us in good 
stead in these countries for decades. Later in 
this letter, I will talk about another poten-
tially serious issue – Britain possibly leaving 
the European Union.
How do you manage your interest rate exposure? Are you worried about negative interest rates 
and the growing differences across countries?
No, we are not worried about negative 
interest rates in the United States. For years, 
this country has had fairly consistent job 
growth and increasingly strong consumers 
(home prices are up, and the consumer 
balance sheet is in the best shape it’s ever 
been in). Housing is in short supply, and 
household formation is going up, car sales are 
at record levels, and we see that consumers 
are spending the gas dividend. Companies 
are financially sound – while some segments’ 
profits are down, companies have plenty of 
cash. Nor are we worried about the diverging 
interest rate policies around the world. While 
they are a reasonable cause for concern, it 
19
19
is also natural that countries with different 
growth rates and varying monetary and fiscal 
policies will have different interest rates and 
currency movements. 
I am a little more concerned about the oppo-
site: seeing interest rates rise faster than 
people expect. We hope rates will rise for a 
good reason; i.e., strong growth in the United 
States. Deflationary forces are receding – 
the deflationary effects of a stronger U.S. 
dollar plus low commodity and oil prices 
will disappear. Wages appear to be going up, 
and China seems to be stabilizing. Finally, 
on a technical basis, the largest buyers of 
U.S. Treasuries since the Great Recession 
have been the U.S. Federal Reserve, countries 
adding to their foreign exchange reserve 
(such as China) and U.S. commercial banks 
(in order to meet liquidity requirements). 
These three buyers of U.S. Treasuries will not 
be there in the future. If we ever get a little 
more consumer and business confidence, 
that would increase the demand for credit, 
as well as reduce the incentive and desire 
of certain investors to buy U.S. Treasuries 
because Treasuries are the “safe haven.” If 
this scenario were to happen with interest 
rates on 10-year Treasuries on the rise, the 
result is unlikely to be as smooth as we all 
might hope for.
Are you worried about liquidity in the marketplace? What does it mean for JPMorgan Chase,  
its clients and the broader economy?
It is good to have healthy markets – it 
sounds obvious, but it’s worth repeating. 
There are markets in virtually everything 
– from corn, soybeans and wheat to eggs, 
chicken and pork to cotton, commodities 
and even the weather. For some reason, 
the debate about having healthy financial 
markets has become less civil and rational. 
Healthy financial markets allow investors 
to buy cheaper and issuers to issue cheaper. 
It is important to have liquidity in difficult 
times in the financial markets because 
investors and corporations often have a 
greater and unexpected need for cash.
Liquidity has gotten worse and we have seen 
extreme volatility and distortions in several 
markets.
In the last year or two, we have seen 
extreme volatility in the U.S. Treasury 
market, the G10 foreign exchange markets 
and the U.S. equity markets. We have also 
seen more than normal volatility in global 
credit markets. These violent market swings 
are usually an indication of poor liquidity. 
Another peculiar event in the market is tech-
nical but important: U.S. Treasuries have 
been selling at a discount to their maturity-
related interest rate swaps.
One of the surprises is that these markets are 
some of the most actively traded, liquid and 
standardized in the world. The good news is 
that the system is resilient enough to handle 
the volatility. The bad news is that we don’t 
completely understand why this is happening. 
There are multiple reasons why this volatility may 
be happening:
• There are fewer market-makers in many 
markets.
• Market-makers hold less inventory – prob-
ably due to the higher capital and liquidity 
required to be held against trading assets. 
• Smaller sizes of trades being offered. It 
is true that the bid-ask spreads are still 
narrow but only if you are buying or selling 
a small amount of securities.
• Lower availability and higher cost of securi-
ties financing (securities financing is very 
short-term borrowing, fully and safely collat-
eralized by Treasuries and agency securi-
ties), which often is used for normal money 
market operations – movement of collat-
eral, short-term money market investing 
and legitimate hedging activities. This is 
clearly due to the higher cost of capital and 
liquidity under the new capital rules. 
20
20
We really need to be prepared for the effects of 
illiquidity when we have bad markets.
In bad markets, liquidity normally dries up 
a bit – the risk is that it will disappear more 
quickly. Many of the new rules are even 
more procyclical than they were in the 2008 
financial crisis. In addition, psychologically, 
the Great Recession is still front and center in 
people’s minds, and the instinct to run for the 
exit may continue to be strong. The real risk 
is that high volatility, rapidly dropping prices, 
and the inability of certain investors and 
issuers to raise money may not be isolated to 
the financial markets. These may feed back 
into the real economy as they did in 2008. 
The trading markets are adjusting to the new 
world. There are many non-bank participants 
that are starting to fill in some of the gaps. 
Even corporations are holding more cash and 
liquidity to be more prepared for tough times. 
So this is something to keep an eye on – but 
not something to panic about.
In a capitalistic and competitive system, 
we are completely supportive of competi-
tors trying to fill marketplace needs. One 
warning, however: Non-bank lenders that 
borrow from individuals and hedge funds 
or that rely on asset-backed securities will be 
unable to get all the funding they need in a 
crisis. This is not a systemic issue because 
they are still small in size, but it will affect 
funding to individuals, small businesses and 
some middle market companies.
JPMorgan Chase is well-positioned regardless.
It is important for you to know that we 
are not overly worried about these issues 
for JPMorgan Chase. We always try to be 
prepared to handle violent markets. Our 
actual trading businesses are very strong 
(and it should give you some comfort to 
know that in all the trading days over the last 
three years, we only had losses on fewer than 
20 days, which is extraordinary). Sometimes 
wider spreads actually help market-makers, 
and some repricing of balance sheet posi-
tions, like repo, already have helped the 
consistency of our results. As usual, we try to 
be there for our clients – in good times and, 
more important, in tough times. 
• Incomplete and sometimes confusing 
rules around securitizations and mort-
gages. We still have not finished all 
the rules around securitizations and in 
conjunction with far higher capital costs 
against certain types of securitizations. 
We have not had a healthy return to the 
securitization market. 
• The requirement to report all trades. 
This makes it much more difficult to buy 
securities in quantity, particularly illiquid 
securities, because the whole world knows 
your positions. This has led to a greater 
discount for almost all off-the-run securi-
ties (these are the securities of an issuer 
that are less regularly traded).
• Possible structural issues; e.g., high-
frequency trading. High-frequency 
trading usually takes place in small incre-
ments with most high-frequency traders 
beginning and ending the day with very 
little inventory. It appears that traders add 
liquidity during the day in liquid markets, 
but they mostly disappear in illiquid 
markets. (I should point out that many 
dealers also disappear in illiquid markets.)
All trading positions have capital, liquidity, 
disclosure and Volcker Rule requirements – 
and they cause high GSIB capital surcharges 
and CCAR losses. It is virtually impossible 
to figure out the cumulative effect of all the 
requirements or what contributes to what.
In our opinion, lower liquidity and higher 
volatility are here to stay.
One could reasonably argue that lower 
liquidity and higher volatility are not neces-
sarily a bad thing. We may have had artifi-
cially higher liquidity in the past, and we are 
experiencing a return closer to normal. You 
certainly could argue that if this is a cost of 
a stronger financial system, it is a reason-
able tradeoff. Remember, the real cost is that 
purchasers and issuers of securities will, over 
time, simply pay more to buy or sell. In any 
event, lower liquidity and higher volatility 
are probably here to stay, and everyone will 
just have to learn to live with them.

We need to protect our customers, their data and 
our company.
We necessarily have a huge amount of data 
about our customers because of under-
writing, credit card transactions and other 
activities, and we use some of this data to 
help serve our customers better (I’ll speak 
more about big data later in this letter). 
And we do extensive work to protect our 
customers and their data – think cyber-
security, fraud protection, etc. We always 
start from the position that we want to be 
customer friendly. One item that I think 
warrants special attention is when our 
customers want to allow outside parties to 
have access to their bank accounts and their 
bank account information. Our customers 
have done this with payment companies, 
aggregators, financial planners and others. 
We want to be helpful, but we have a respon-
sibility to each of our customers, and we are 
extremely concerned. Let me explain why: 
• When we all readily click “I agree” online 
or on our mobile devices, allowing third-
party access to our bank accounts and 
financial information, it is fairly clear 
that most of us have no idea what we 
are agreeing to or how that informa-
tion might be used by a third party. We 
have analyzed many of the contracts of 
these third parties and have come to the 
following conclusions:
– Far more information is taken than the 
third party needs in order to do its job. 
– Many third parties sell or trade infor-
mation in a way customers may not 
understand, and the third parties, 
quite often, are doing it for their own 
economic benefit – not for the custom-
er’s benefit. 
– Often this is being done on a daily basis 
for years after the customer signed up 
for the services, which they may no 
longer be using.
We simply are asking third parties to limit 
themselves to what they need in order to 
serve the customer and to let the customer 
know exactly what information is being used 
and why and how. In the future, instead 
of giving a third party unlimited access to 
information in any bank account, we hope to 
build systems that allow us to “push” infor-
mation – and only that information agreed to 
by the customer – to that third party.
• Pushing specific information has another 
benefit: Customers do not need to provide 
their bank passcode. When customers 
give out their bank passcode, they may 
not realize that if a rogue employee at 
an aggregator uses this passcode to steal 
money from the customer’s account, the 
customer, not the bank, is responsible for 
any loss. You can rest assured that when 
the bank is responsible for the loss, the 
customer will be fully reimbursed. That 
is not quite clear with many third parties. 
This lack of clarity and transparency isn’t 
fair or right. 
Privacy is of the utmost importance. We 
need to protect our customers and their data. 
We are now actively working with all third 
parties who are willing to work with us to set 
up data sharing the right way.
Why are you making such a big deal about protecting customers’ data in your bank?

III. WE ACTIVELY DEVELOP AND SUPPORT OUR EMPLOYEES
If you were able to travel the world with 
me, to virtually all major cities and coun-
tries, you would see firsthand your company 
in action and the high quality and character 
of our people. JPMorgan Chase and all its 
predecessor companies have prided them-
selves on doing “only first-class business and 
in a first-class way.” Much of the capability 
of this company resides in the knowledge, 
expertise and relationships of our people. And 
while we always try to bring in fresh talent 
and new perspectives, we are proud that our 
senior bankers have an average tenure of 15 
years. This is testament to their experience, 
and it means they know who to call anywhere 
around the world to bring the full resources of 
JPMorgan Chase to bear for our clients.
Traveling with me, you would see our senior 
leadership team’s exceptional character, 
culture and capability. You also would 
probably notice that 20% of this leadership 
group, over 250 teammates who manage 
our businesses worldwide, is ethnically 
diverse, and more than 30% are women. 
Even though we believe that we have excel-
lent people and a strong, positive corporate 
culture, we are always examining new ways 
to improve.
How are you ensuring you have the right conduct and culture?
We reinforce our culture every chance we get.
Our Business Principles are at the forefront 
of everything we do, and we need to make 
these principles part of every major conver-
sation at the company – from the hiring, 
onboarding and training of new recruits to 
town halls and management meetings to how 
we reward and incentivize our people. To 
get better at this, last year we met with more 
than 16,000 employees in 1,400 focus groups 
around the world to get their feedback on 
some of our challenges and what we can do  
to strengthen and improve our culture.
That said, we acknowledge that we, at times, 
have fallen short of the standards we have 
set for ourselves. This year, the company 
pleaded guilty to a single antitrust viola-
tion as part of a settlement with the U.S. 
Department of Justice related to foreign 
exchange activities. The conduct underlying 
the antitrust charge is principally attribut-
able to a single trader (who has since been 
dismissed) and his coordination with traders 
at other firms. As we said at the time, one 
lesson is that the conduct of a small group of 
employees, or of even a single employee, can 
reflect badly on all of us and can have signifi-
cant ramifications for the entire firm. That’s 
why we must be ever vigilant in our commit-
ment to fortify our controls and enhance 
our historically strong culture, continuing 
to underscore that doing the right thing is 
the responsibility of every employee at the 
company. We all have an obligation to treat 
our customers and clients fairly, to raise our 
hand when we see something wrong or to 
speak up about something that we should 
improve – rather than just complain about it 
or ignore it. 
We have intensified training and development.
We are committed to properly training and 
developing our people to enable them to 
grow and succeed throughout their careers. 
Our intent is to create effective leaders who 
embody our Business Principles. 
23

WE ARE HELPING OUR EMPLOYEES STAY HEALTHY
 
For us, having healthy employees is about more than improving 
the firm’s bottom line; it’s about improving our employees’ lives 
— and sometimes even saving lives. In 2015, we estimate that our 
Health & Wellness Centers intervened in more than 100 poten-
tially life-threatening situations (e.g., urgent cardiac or respiratory 
issues), and many more lives have been positively impacted by our 
numerous wellness initiatives. We believe that healthy employees 
are happy employees and that happy employees have more 
rewarding lives both inside and outside the office. 
Our commitment starts with offering comprehensive benefits 
programs and policies that support our employees and their 
families. To do this, JPMorgan Chase spent $1.1 billion in 2015 
on medical benefits for employees based in the United States, 
where our medical plan covers more than 190,000 employees, 
spouses and partners. We tier our insurance subsidies so our 
higher earners pay more, and our lower earners pay less — making 
coverage appropriately affordable for all. We also contributed 
nearly $100 million in 2015 for employees’ Medical Reimbursement 
Accounts. And we have structured the plan in a way that preventa-
tive care and screenings are paid for by the company. 
Our benefits offering is supported by an extensive Wellness 
Program, which is designed to empower employees to take charge 
of their health. This includes health and wellness centers, health 
assessments and screenings, health advocates, employee assis-
tance and emotional well-being programs, and physical activity 
events. In the first year, only 36% of employees participated in 
health assessments and wellness screenings, but in 2015, 74% of 
our employees enrolled in the medical plan completed an assess-
ment and screening. Last year, our on-site wellness screenings 
helped almost 14,000 employees detect a health risk or poten-
tially serious condition and directed them to see a physician for 
follow-up. On another subject, we all know the value of eating lots 
of vegetables, so we’ve made it a priority to offer an abundance 
of healthy meal and snack options in our on-site cafeterias and 
vending machines.
One of the flagships of our Wellness Program is our Health 
& Wellness Center network. Twenty-seven of our 29 centers 
in the United States are staffed with at least one doctor. 
Nearly half of our employees have access to a local center, 
and 56% of those with access walked in for a visit last year. 
These facilities are vitally important to our people. In 2015, 
these centers handled nearly 800 emergencies — including 
the 100 potentially life-saving interventions, which I 
mentioned above. 
Maintaining a healthy lifestyle shouldn’t be a chore — it 
should be fun. Last year, we held our second StepUp 
challenge, a global competition that not only kept our 
employees active, it supported five charities that feed the 
hungry. More than 11,000 teams — a total of over 83,000 
employees — added up their daily steps to take a virtual walk 
around the world. They began their journey in New York City 
and made virtual stops at seven of our office locations before 
finishing in Sydney. Together, they logged a total of 28.2 
billion steps, which resulted in the firm donating more than 
$2 million to the five designated charities — enough to fund 
millions of meals around the world.

about business issues we have confronted 
and mistakes we have made. In its inaugural 
year, more than 4,500 managers attended 
programs with 156 sessions held at 20+ 
global locations. During 2016, over 13,000 
managers are expected to attend. I person-
ally take part in many of these sessions, 
which are now being held next to our New 
York City headquarters at The Pierpont 
Leadership Center, a state-of-the-art flagship 
training center that opened in January 2016. 
JPMorgan Chase has 3,000 training 
programs, but we realized that we lacked a 
very important one: new manager develop-
ment. Prior to 2015, when our employees 
became managers at the firm for the first 
time, we basically left them on their own to 
figure out their new responsibilities. In 2015, 
we launched JPMorgan Chase’s Leadership 
Edge, a firmwide program to train leaders 
and develop management skills. These 
training programs inculcate our leadership 
with our values, teaching from case studies 
How are you doing in your diversity efforts?
We are proud of our diversity … but we have more 
to do.
Our women leaders represent more than 
30% of our company’s senior leadership, 
and they run major businesses – several 
units on their own would be among Fortune 
1000 companies. In addition to having three 
women on our Operating Committee – 
who run Asset Management, Finance and 
Legal – some of our other businesses and 
functions headed by women include Auto 
Finance, Business Banking, U.S. Private Bank, 
U.S. Mergers & Acquisitions, Global Equity 
Capital Markets, Global Research, Regulatory 
Affairs, Global Philanthropy, our U.S. branch 
network and firmwide Marketing. I believe 
that we have some of the best women leaders 
in the corporate world globally. 
To encourage diversity and inclusion in the 
workplace, we have a number of Business 
Resource Groups (BRG) across the company 
to bring together members around common 
interests, as well as foster networking and 
camaraderie. Groups are defined by shared 
affinities, including race and cultural heritage, 
generation, gender, sexual orientation, mili-
tary status and professional role. For example, 
some of our largest BRGs are Adelante for 
Hispanic and Latino employees, Access Ability 
for employees affected by a disability, AsPIRE 
for Asian and Pacific Islander employees, 
NextGen for early career professionals and 
WIN, which focuses on women and their 
career development. WIN has more than 
20,000 members globally, and we have seen a 
direct correlation between BRG membership 
and increased promotion, mobility and reten-
tion for those participants. On the facing page, 
you can read more about some of the inter-
esting new programs we have rolled out for 
employees in specific situations.
But there is one area where we simply have 
not met the standards that JPMorgan Chase 
sets for itself – and that is in increasing 
African-American talent at the firm. While 
we think our effort to attract and retain 
African-American talent is as good as at 
most other companies, it simply is not good 
enough. Therefore, we set up a devoted effort 
– as we did for hiring veterans (we’ve hired 
10,000+ veterans) – to dramatically step up 
our effort. We have launched Advancing 
Black Leaders – a separately staffed and 
managed initiative to better attract and 
hire more African-American talent while 
retaining, developing and advancing the 
African-American talent we already have. 
We are taking definitive steps to ensure 
a successful outcome, including an incre-
mental $5 million investment, identifying a 
full-time senior executive to drive the initia-
tive, tripling the number of scholarships 
we offer to students in this community, and 
launching bias-awareness training for all 
executive directors and managing directors. 
We hope that, over the years, this concerted 
action will make a huge difference. 
25
25
WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF POLICIES AND PROGRAMS TO MAKE JPMORGAN CHASE AN EVEN BETTER PLACE TO WORK
We want JPMorgan Chase to be considered the best place to 
work — period. Below are some meaningful new programs 
that will help us both attract talent and keep our best people. 
Our ReEntry program. Our ReEntry program, now in its third 
year, has been incredibly successful in helping individuals 
who have taken a five- to 10-year or longer voluntary break 
get back into the workforce. These are highly accomplished 
professionals who have prior financial services experience 
at or above the vice president level but who may need 
help re-entering the corporate work environment. We offer 
participants an 18-week fellowship to refresh their skills and 
rebuild their network. It is a great way to bring outstanding, 
experienced workers — who often are women — to JPMorgan 
Chase to begin the second phase of their career. In three 
years, 63 fellows have been brought into the program, and 
50 of those fellows have been placed in full-time roles.
Maternity mentors. A common reason for taking a prolonged 
break from work is the birth of a child. Becoming a parent is 
both joyful and stressful so we want to do everything we can 
to support our employees through this life-changing event. 
Last year, we extended primary caregiver parental leave to 
16 weeks, up from 12, and, this year, we are introducing a 
firmwide maternity mentorship program. The program will 
pair senior employees who have gone through the parental 
leave process with those who are doing so for the first time. 
It was piloted last year to overwhelmingly positive feedback, 
with participants expressing deep appreciation for having a 
colleague they could turn to for advice on everything from 
how to balance work with their new home dynamic to nursing 
room protocol. Importantly, these senior mentors also provide 
peace of mind around job security and how to manage the 
entire transition, from preparing to leave, managing mother-
hood during the leave and returning to work. In addition, this 
program not only supports the employee going out on mater-
nity leave, but it also helps educate the employee’s manager 
— on how to stay connected with the employee and ensure that 
the leave is being handled with flexibility and sensitivity in order 
to give the employee comfort that her role will be there upon 
her return.
Work-life balance. We speak consistently about the need for our 
employees to take care of their minds, their bodies and their 
souls. This is the responsibility of each and every employee, but 
there are also ways the firm can help. People frequently think 
work-life balance refers to working parents; however, having an 
effective balance is important for everyone’s well-being, including 
our junior investment bankers. In the Investment Bank, we have 
reduced weekend work to only essential execution work for all 
employees. And the protected weekend program for analysts 
and associates will remain in place and now is mandatory for all 
at this level globally.
26

With all the new rules, committees and centralization, how can you fight bureaucracy 
and complacency and keep morale high?
In the reality of our new world, centraliza-
tion of many critical functions is an abso-
lute requirement so that we can maintain 
common standards across the company. 
Of course, extreme centralization can lead 
to stifling bureaucracy, less innovation 
and, counterintuitively, sometimes a lack 
of accountability on the part of those who 
should have it. Our preference is to decen-
tralize when we can, but when we have 
to centralize, we need to ensure we set 
up a process that’s efficient, works for the 
customer and respects the internal colleagues 
who may have lost some local control.
Processes need to be re-engineered to be 
efficient. So far, our managers have done a 
great job adjusting to their new roles and, 
in effect, getting the best of centralization 
without its shortcomings. When, on occa-
sion, new procedures have slowed down our 
response rate to the client, we quickly set 
about re-engineering the process to make 
it better. While we are going to meet and 
exceed all rules and requirements, we need 
to ensure that the process is not duplicative 
or that rules are not misapplied. For example, 
adhering to the new KYC rules took us up 
to 10 days to onboard a client to our Private 
Bank. But today, after re-engineering the 
process, we are back down to three days, 
incorporating enhanced controls. We all need 
to recognize that good processes generally 
are faster, cheaper and safer for all involved, 
including the client.
People should not just accept bureaucracy — they 
have the right to question processes and the 
interpretation of rules. We have given all our 
people the license to question whether what 
we are doing is the right thing, including 
the interpretation of rules and regulations. 
Very often, in our desire to exceed regulatory 
requirements and to avoid making a mistake, 
we have inaccurately interpreted a rule or 
regulation and created our own excessive 
bureaucracy. This is no one’s fault but our 
own. Everyone should look to simplify and 
seek out best practices, including asking our 
regulators for guidance.
Committees need to be properly run — the chair-
person needs to take charge. We have asked all 
our committees to become more efficient. For 
example, we should ensure that pre-reading 
materials are accurate and succinct. The 
right people need to be in the room and very 
rarely should the group exceed 12 people. 
An issue should not be presented to multiple 
committees when it could be dealt with in 
just one committee (remember, we have new 
business initiative approval committees, 
credit committees, reputational risk commit-
tees, capital governance committees, global 
technology architecture committees and 
hundreds of others). 
We have asked that each chair of every 
committee take charge – start meetings on 
time, make sure people arrive prepared and 
actually have read the pre-read documents, 
eliminate frivolous conversation, force the 
right questions to get to a decision, read the 
riot act to someone behaving badly, maintain 
a detailed follow-up list specifying who is 
responsible for what and when, and ensure 
the committee meets its obligations and time 
commitments. And last, we encourage each 
chair to ask the internal customers if he or 
she is doing a good job for them.
We have maintained high morale. Our people 
have embraced the new regulations and are 
working hard to become the gold standard 
in how we operate. We don’t spend any time 
finger-pointing or scapegoating our own 
people, looking for someone to blame purely 
for the sake of doing so when we make a 
mistake. And importantly, we have main-
tained a culture that allows for mistakes. 
Obviously, if someone violates our core prin-
ciples, that person should not be here. But as 
you know, there are all types of mistakes.  
27
27
We don’t want to be known as a company 
that doesn’t give people a second chance 
regardless of the circumstances. I remind all 
our managers that some of these mistakes 
will be made by our children, our spouses 
or our parents. Having a brutal, uncompro-
mising and unforgiving company will create 
a terrible culture over time – and it will lead 
to worse conduct not better. 
Quite well, thank you. The Board of Directors 
and I feel we have one of the best manage-
ment teams we have ever had. Many of our 
investors who have spent a considerable 
amount of time with our leaders – not just 
with my direct reports but with the layer 
of management below them – will tell you 
how impressed they are with the depth and 
breadth of our management team. Of course, 
we have lost some people, but we wish them 
well – we are proud of our alumni. One of 
the negatives of being a good company is 
that you do become a breeding ground for 
talent and a recruiting target for competitors. 
It is the job of our management team to keep 
our key talent educated, engaged, motivated 
and happy. Our people are so good that we 
should say thank you every day.
How are you doing retaining key people?
Our company has stood the test of time 
because we are building a strong culture and 
are embedding our principles in everything 
we do. Nothing is more important. That is 
the pillar upon which all things rest – and it 
is the foundation for a successful future.
28
IV.  WE ARE HERE TO SERVE OUR CLIENTS
We have to be innovating all the time to 
succeed. Investing in the future is critical 
to our business and crucial for our growth. 
Every year we ask, “Are we doing enough? 
And should we be spending more?” We do 
not cut back on “good spending” to meet 
budget or earnings targets. We view this type 
of cost cutting like an airline scaling back 
on maintenance – it’s a bad idea. We spent 
more than $9 billion last year on technology. 
Importantly, 30% of this total amount was 
spent on new investments for the future. 
Today, we have more than 40,000 technolo-
gists, from programmers and analysts to 
systems engineers and application designers. 
In addition, our resources include 31 data 
centers, 67,000 physical servers globally, 
27,920 databases and a global network that 
operates smoothly for all our clients. There 
are many new technologies that I will not 
discuss here (think cloud, containerization 
and virtualization) but which will make 
every single part of this ecosystem increas-
ingly more efficient over time.
We need to innovate in both big and small ways.
Technology often comes in big waves – such 
as computerization, the Internet and mobile 
devices. However, plenty of important 
innovation involves lots of little things that 
are additive over time and make a product 
or a service better or faster; for example, 
simplifying online applications, improving 
ATMs to do more (e.g., depositing checks) 
and speeding up credit underwriting. Many 
of these improvements were not just the 
result of technology but the result of teams 
of people across Legal, Finance, Technology 
and Client Coverage & Support working 
together to understand, simplify and auto-
mate processes. 
One of our growing teams is our digital 
group, including more than 400 profes-
sionals focused on product and platform 
design and innovation. In addition, the digital 
technology organization has over 1,200 
technologists that deliver digital solutions, 
including frameworks, development and 
architecture. This is an exceptional group, 
but you can judge for yourself when you 
read about some of the great projects being 
rolled out. 
We have thousands of such projects, but I 
just want to give you a sample of some of 
our current initiatives (I will talk extensively 
later about investments in payments, in big 
data and in our Investment Bank):
• Consumer digital. We are intently focused 
on delivering differentiated digital experi-
ences across our consumer businesses. 
For example, we added new functionality 
to our mobile app with account preview 
and check viewing, and we redesigned 
chase.com with simpler navigation and 
more personalized experiences, making 
it easier for our customers to bank and 
interact with us when and how they want 
– via smartphones, laptops and other 
mobile devices. We now have nearly 23 
million active Chase Mobile customers,  
a 20% increase over the prior year.
Many of the new and exciting things we are 
doing center on technology, including big 
data and FinTech. We are continually inno-
vating to serve our clients better, faster and 
cheaper – year after year.
How do you view innovation, technology and FinTech? And have banks been good innovators? 
Do you have economies of scale, and how are they benefiting your clients?

• Digital and Global Wealth Management. 
We will be investing approximately 
$300 million over the next three years 
in digital initiatives for Asset Manage-
ment. In Global Wealth Management, we 
have modernized the online experience 
for clients, enabled mobile access, and 
launched a digital portal for access to our 
research and analysis across all channels. 
In addition, we are rolling out a user-
friendly and powerful planning tool that 
our advisors can use with clients in real 
time. We are also working on some great 
new initiatives around digital wealth 
management, which we will disclose  
later this year.
• Digital Commercial Banking. In Commercial 
Banking, J.P. Morgan ACCESS delivers a 
platform for clients to manage and pull 
together all their Treasury activities in a 
single, secure portal, which was ranked as 
the #1 cash management portal in North 
America by Greenwich Associates in 2014. 
We continue to invest in digital enhance-
ments, releasing in 2015 our proprietary 
and integrated mobile solution for remote 
check deposits to help clients further 
streamline their back-office reconciliations. 
We are also investing in improving the 
overall user experience around key items 
such as entitlements (designating who can 
make payments) and workflow, bringing 
to our commercial digital platforms some 
of the same enhancements we’ve brought 
to our Consumer Banking sites. 
 While we make a huge effort to protect 
our own company in terms of cybersecu-
rity, we try to help protect our clients from 
cyber threats as well. We have extensive 
fraud and malware detection capabilities 
that significantly reduce wire fraud on 
our customers. We’ve increased our client 
cybersecurity education and awareness 
programs, having communicated with 
more than 11,000 corporate customers on 
this topic and hosting nearly 50 cybersecu-
rity client events in 2015.
• Small business digital. Small businesses are 
important to Chase and to the communi-
ties we serve. Small businesses have a 
variety of banking needs, with approxi-
mately 60% of our customers using our 
checking accounts or business credit cards. 
And like our consumer client base, they 
depend heavily on the technology that 
already is offered in our Consumer busi-
ness. But we are very excited about two 
new initiatives this year:
– Our new brand “Chase for Business” 
is not just a brand. Over time, we will 
simplify forms, speed applications and 
dramatically improve the customer 
experience. This year or next, we 
will roll out an online digital applica-
tion that allows a Business Banking 
customer to sign up for the “triple 
play” with one signature and in one 
day. “Triple play” stands for a deposit 
account, a business credit card and 
Chase merchant processing – all at 
once. Now that’s customer service! 
– Chase Business Quick Capital. Working 
with a FinTech company called OnDeck, 
we will be piloting a new working 
capital product. The process will be 
entirely digital, with approval and 
funding generally received within one 
day vs. the current process that can 
take up to one month or more. The 
loans will be Chase branded, retained 
on our balance sheet, and subject to our 
pricing and risk parameters. 
• Commercial Term Lending. In our Commer-
cial Term Lending business, our competi-
tive advantage is our process – we strive 
to close commercial real estate loans 
faster and more efficiently than the 
industry average. That has allowed us 
to drive $25 billion of loan growth since 
2010, representing a five-year compound 
average growth rate (CAGR) of 11% 
and outpacing the industry CAGR of 
4% while maintaining credit discipline. 
Technological innovation will continue to 
improve our process – later in the year, 
we will be rolling out a proprietary loan 
29
30
origination system that will set a new 
industry standard for closure speed and 
customer service.
Yes, we are always improving our economies 
of scale (to the ultimate benefit of our clients). 
And yes, over time, banks have been enormous 
innovators.
We commonly hear the comment that a bank 
of our size cannot generate economies of 
scale that benefit the client. And we often 
hear people say that banks don’t innovate. 
Neither of these comments is accurate. Below 
I give a few examples of the large and small 
innovations that we are working on:
• Consumer and small business banking 
accounts. Many decades ago, bank accounts 
meant checks and a monthly statement, 
with few additional benefits provided to 
customers (other than maybe a toaster). 
Today, most checking accounts come with 
many benefits: debit cards, online bill pay, 
24-hour access to online account informa-
tion, fraud alerts, mobile banking, relevant 
rewards and ATM access.
• ATMs. Today, ATMs are ubiquitous (we 
have almost 18,000 ATMs, and our 
customers love them). These ATMs have 
gone from simple cash dispensers to 
state-of-the-art service centers, allowing 
customers to receive different denomina-
tions of bills, accept deposited checks, pay 
certain bills and access all their accounts. 
• The cost and ability to raise capital and buy 
and sell securities. Thirty years ago, it cost, 
on average, 15 cents to trade a share of 
stock, 100 basis points to buy or sell a 
corporate single-A bond and $200,000 
to do a $100 million interest rate swap. 
Today, it costs, on average, 1.5 cents to 
trade a share of stock, 10 basis points to 
buy a corporate single-A bond and $10,000 
to do a $100 million interest rate swap. 
And much can be done electronically, 
increasingly on a mobile device and with 
mostly straight-through processing, which 
reduces error rates and operational costs – 
for both us and our clients. These capa-
bilities have dramatically reduced costs 
to investors and issuers for capital raising 
and securities transactions.
• Cash management capabilities for corpora-
tions. It is impossible to describe in a few 
sentences what companies had to do to 
move money around the world 40 years 
ago. Today, people can move money glob-
ally on mobile devices and immediately 
convert it into almost any currency they 
want. They have instant access to informa-
tion, and the cost is a fraction of what it 
used to be. 
FinTech and innovation have been going on my 
entire career — it’s just faster today. 
If you look at the banking business over 
decades, it has always been a huge user of 
new technologies. This has been going on 
my entire career, though it does appear to be 
accelerating and coming at us from many 
different angles. While many FinTech firms 
are good at utilizing new technologies, we 
should recognize that they are very good 
at analyzing and fixing business problems 
and improving the customer experience (i.e., 
reducing pain points). Sometimes they find a 
way to provide these services more efficiently 
and in a less costly manner; for example, 
cloud services. And sometimes these services 
are not less expensive but provide a faster and 
simplified experience that customers value 
and are willing to pay for. You see this in 
some FinTech lending and payment services. 
It is unquestionable that FinTech will force 
financial institutions to move more quickly, 
and banks, regulators and government policy 
will need to keep pace. Services will be rolled 
out faster, and more of them will be executed 
on a mobile device. FinTech has been great at 
making it easier and often less expensive for 
customers and will likely lead to many more 
people, including more lower-income people, 
joining the banking system in the United 
States and abroad. 
30
31
You can rest assured that we continually 
and vigorously analyze the marketplace, 
including FinTech companies. We want to 
stay up to date and be extremely informed, 
and we are always looking for ways to 
improve what we do. We are perfectly 
willing to compete by building capabilities 
(we have large capabilities in-house) or to 
collaborate by partnering. 
Whether we compete or collaborate, we 
try to do what is in the best interest of 
the customer. We also partner with more 
than 100 FinTech companies – just as we 
have partnered over the past decade with 
hundreds of other technology providers. We 
need to be very technologically competent 
because we know that some of our competi-
tors will be very good. All businesses have 
clear weak spots, and those weaknesses will 
be – and should be – exploited by competi-
tors. This is how competitive markets work. 
One of the areas we spend a lot of time 
thinking and worrying about is payments. 
Part of the payments system is based on 
archaic, legacy architecture that is often 
unfriendly to the customer.
How do you intend to win in payments, particularly with so many strong competitors — many 
from Silicon Valley? 
Right now, we are one of the biggest 
payments companies in the world (across 
credit and debit cards, merchant payments, 
global wire transfers, etc.). But that has not 
lulled us into a false sense of security – and 
we know we need to continue to innovate 
aggressively to grow and win in this area. 
The trifecta of Chase Paymentech, ChaseNet 
and Chase Pay, supported by significant 
investment in innovation, has us very excited 
and gives us a great opportunity to continue 
to be one of the leading companies in the 
payments business. Let me explain why. 
Chase Paymentech. We already are one of the 
largest merchant processors in the United 
States (merchant processors provide those 
little machines that you swipe your card 
through at the point of sale in a store or 
that process online payments). We are 
quickly signing up large and medium-sized 
merchants – this year alone, we signed 
up some names that you all recognize, 
including Starbucks, Chevron, Marriott, 
Rite Aid and Cinemark. And I’ve already 
described how the partnership with Busi-
ness Banking makes it easier for small busi-
nesses to connect with Chase Paymentech. 
In all these instances, we have simplified, 
and, in some cases, offered better pricing, 
as well as made signup easier – exactly 
what the merchants want. And very often it 
comes with … ChaseNet.
ChaseNet. ChaseNet, through Visa, allows us 
to offer a merchant different and cheaper 
pricing, a streamlined contract and rules, and 
enhanced data sharing, which can facilitate 
sales and authorization rates. Again, these 
are all things merchants want. (You can 
see that we are trying hard to improve the 
relationship between banks and merchants.) 
We expect volume in ChaseNet to reach 
approximately $50 billion in 2016 (up 100% 
from 2015), as we have signed up and are 
starting to onboard clients such as Starbucks, 
Chevron, Marriott and Rite Aid. In conjunc-
tion with Chase Paymentech and ChaseNet, 
both of which allow us to offer merchants 
great deals, we also can offer … Chase Pay.
Chase Pay. Chase Pay, our Chase-branded 
digital wallet, is the digital equivalent to 
using your debit or credit card. It will allow 
you to pay online with a “Chase Pay” button 
or in-store with your mobile phone. We also 
hope to get the Chase Pay button inside 
merchant apps. Chase Pay will offer lower 
cost of payment, loyalty programs and fraud 
liability protection to merchants, as well 
as simple checkout, loyalty rewards and 
account protection to consumers. As one great 
example, Chase has signed a payments agree-
ment with Starbucks, which, we hope, will 
drive Chase Pay adoption. Customers will be 
able to use the Chase Pay mobile app at more 
31
32
than 7,500 company-operated Starbucks loca-
tions in the United States and to reload a Star-
bucks Card within the Starbucks mobile app 
and on starbucks.com. Finally, to make Chase 
Pay even more attractive, we are building … 
real-time person-to-person (P2P) payments.
Real-time P2P payments. In conjunction with 
six partner banks, Chase is launching a P2P 
solution with real-time funds availability. The 
new P2P solution will securely make real-time 
funds available through a single consumer-
facing brand. Chase and the partner banks 
represent 60% of all U.S. consumers with 
mobile banking apps. We intend to keep P2P 
free for consumers, and the network consor-
tium is open for all banks to join.
We are absolutely convinced that the trifecta 
– Chase Paymentech, ChaseNet and Chase 
Pay – will be dramatically better, cheaper and 
safer for our customers and our merchants. 
We also are convinced that the investments 
we are making in Chase Paymentech and 
ChaseNet will pay off handsomely. The 
investment in Chase Pay is not as certain. But 
we think that the investment will be worth 
it and that it will help drive more merchants 
wanting to do business with us and more 
customers wanting to open checking 
accounts with us and use our credit cards. 
I also want to mention one more payment 
capability, this one for our corporate clients: 
Corporate QuickPay. Leveraging tremendous 
investment in our retail payment capa-
bilities, our wholesale businesses launched 
Corporate QuickPay in 2015. This mobile and 
web-based solution provides our clients with 
a low-cost alternative to expensive paper 
checks, reducing their expenses by almost 
two-thirds. In addition, the platform dramati-
cally improves security, increases payment-
processing speed, eases reporting and signifi-
cantly enhances the customer experience. 
I hope you can see why we are so excited.
You always seem to be segmenting your businesses — how and why are you doing this?
We will always be segmenting our busi-
nesses to become more knowledgeable about 
and closer to the client. This segmentation 
allows us to tailor our products and services 
to better serve their needs. Below are some 
examples of how and why we do this.
In Consumer Banking, we have the benefit of 
really knowing our customers. We know 
about their financial stability, interests, 
where they live and their families. That data 
can be a tremendous force in serving them. 
By understanding customers well beyond a 
demographic profile, we can better antici-
pate what they need. Historically, we used 
demographics and behavior to segment our 
customers, but we increasingly take attitudes, 
values and aspirations into consideration 
to offer each customer more relevant and 
personalized products, services and rewards. 
As one important example, we hope to roll 
out an “Always On Offers” section for our 
customers on chase.com, where they can 
access all the products they qualify for at  
any given time. 
In Commercial Banking, we continue to develop 
and enhance our Specialized Industries 
coverage, which now serves a total of 15 
distinct industries and approximately 9,000 
clients across the United States, with eight 
industries launched in the last five years. 
Below are a few service examples taken from 
these new industries:
• Agricultural industry group. Not only do we 
have specialized underwriting for clients 
within this group, but we also can help 
our clients navigate commodity price 
cycles and seasonality, as well as provide 
industry-specific credit and risk manage-
ment tools, such as interest rate and 
commodity hedging. 
32
33
• Healthcare industry group. In addition to 
delivering access to capital and other 
financial services, we can help our 
healthcare clients manage the constantly 
changing regulatory environment and 
adjust their businesses to comply with the 
Patient Protection and Affordable Care 
Act and other new regulations. In addi-
tion, our web-based tools are making it 
easier for healthcare providers to migrate 
payments from expensive paper checks to 
efficient electronic transactions.
• Technology industry group. To serve our 
technology clients, we have expanded 
our coverage to include 30 bankers in 
11 key markets, all highly aligned with 
our Investment Banking team. With 
this model, we can provide investment 
banking services, comprehensive payment 
capabilities and international products to 
address the needs of technology clients 
through every stage of growth. 
In Asset Management, we have dedicated 
groups that cover highly specialized segments. 
Some of these segments are: Defined Benefit 
Pension Plans, Defined Contribution Pension 
Plans, Endowments & Foundations, Family 
Offices and Insurance Companies. 
How and why do you use big data?
We have enormous quantities of data, and 
we have always been data fanatics, using 
big data responsibly in loan underwriting, 
market-making, client selection, credit under-
writing and risk management, among other 
areas. But comparing today’s big data with 
yesterday’s old-style data is like the differ-
ence between a mobile phone and a rotary 
phone. Big data truly is powerful and can be 
used extensively to improve our company. 
To best utilize our data assets and spur 
innovation, we have built our own extraor-
dinary in-house big data capabilities – we 
think as good as any in Silicon Valley – 
populated with more than 200 analysts and 
data scientists, which we call Intelligent 
Solutions. And we are starting to use these 
capabilities across all our businesses. I want 
to give you a sample of what we are doing – 
and it is just the beginning:
• Commercial Banking. We are using big data 
in many ways in Commercial Banking. 
One area is responsible prospecting. It 
always was hard to get a proper list of 
client prospects (i.e., get the prospect’s 
working telephone number or email 
address, get an accurate description of the 
business and maybe get an introduction 
to the decision maker at the company). 
Using big data, we have uncovered and 
qualified twice as many high-quality pros-
pects, and we are significantly more effec-
tive in assuring that the best banker is 
calling on the highest-potential prospects. 
This has given us confidence in knowing 
that if we hire more bankers, they can be 
profitably deployed.
• Consumer Banking. Within the Consumer 
Bank, we use big data to improve under-
writing, deliver more targeted marketing 
and analyze the root causes of customer 
attrition. This will lead to more accounts, 
higher marketing efficiencies, reduced 
costs and happy customers.
33
34
• Operational efficiencies. In the Corporate & 
Investment Bank, big data is being used 
to analyze errors, thereby improving 
operational efficiencies. In one example, in 
our Custody business, big data is helping 
identify and explain the breaks and vari-
ances in the calculation of net asset values 
of funds, thereby reducing the operational 
burden and improving client service.
• Operational intelligence. Our technology 
infrastructure creates an enormous 
amount of machine data from which we 
gain valuable operational intelligence. This 
information helps support the stability 
and resiliency of our systems – enabling 
us to identify little problems before they 
become big problems.
• Fraud security and surveillance. Needless to 
say, these big data capabilities are being 
used to decrease fraud, reduce risk in the 
cyber world, and even monitor internal 
systems to detect employee fraud and 
bad behavior.
Why are you investing in sales and trading, as well as in your Investment Bank, when others 
seem to be cutting back?
Trading is an absolutely critical function 
in modern society – for investors large and 
small and for corporations and governments. 
As the world grows, the absolute need for 
trading will increase globally as assets under 
management, trade, corporate clients and 
economies grow. We disclosed on Investor 
Day that we continue to make a fair profit in 
almost all our trading businesses despite the 
higher costs and what is probably a perma-
nent reduction in volumes. While the busi-
ness will always be cyclical, we are convinced 
that our clients will continue to need broad 
services in all asset classes and that we have 
the scale to be profitable through the cycle. 
Sales and trading educates the world about 
companies, securities and economies. Clients 
will always need advice and the ability to 
transact. This education also makes it easier 
for corporations to sell their securities so 
they can invest and grow. Much of the invest-
ment we are making in sales and trading is 
in technology, both to adjust to new regula-
tions and to make access to trading faster, 
cheaper and safer than it has been in the 
past. Across electronic trading, we have seen 
a doubling of users and significant volume 
increases of 175% across products in just the 
last year. Below are a few examples:
Foreign exchange (FX). We continue to make 
significant investments in FX e-trading and 
our single-dealer platform. More than 95% 
of our FX spot transactions are now done 
electronically as the market has increasingly 
shifted to electronic execution over the years. 
We were also first to deliver FX trading on 
mobile devices through our award-winning 
eXecute application on the J.P. Morgan 
Markets platform. Our continued investment 
in the FX business, in which we process an 
average of nearly 500,000 trades each day, 
has propelled us to be a leader in the market. 
Equities. In the last five years, on the back 
of our investments in both technology 
and people, our U.S. electronic cash equity 
market share has nearly quadrupled. We 
have also witnessed an increased straight-
through processing rate – going from 70% 
two years ago to 97% today.
Prime Brokerage. Our Prime Brokerage plat-
form, which was once a predominantly U.S. 
operation, is now a top-tier global business 
that continues to grow clients and balances. 
Our international and DMA (direct market 
access) electronic footprint has expanded 
rapidly since 2012. Financing balances 
are at all-time highs, with international 
balances up more than 60% and synthetic 
balances up more than 350%, simultane-
ously reducing balance sheet consumption 
and enhancing returns. 
34
35
Rates trading. With the adoption of new 
regulations, we anticipate that this market 
will also continue to see increased volumes of 
e-trading. As a result, we have developed auto-
mated pricing systems that can price swaps in 
a fraction of a second on electronic platforms. 
Our SEF (swap execution facility) aggregator 
allows clients to see the best price available to 
them across the global market of interest rate 
swaps and “click to trade” via our platform on 
an agency basis. This helps our clients execute 
transactions via any channel they desire, on 
a principal or agent basis. Today, over 50% of 
our U.S. dollar swaps volume is traded and 
processed electronically. 
Commodities. Leveraging our FX capabilities, 
we have developed a complete electronic 
offering in precious and base metals. We 
are also extending the same capabilities to 
energy products, where we have executed 
our first electronic trade in oil. We plan to 
further extend our e-trading capabilities 
across the commodities markets, including 
agricultural products. 
Derivatives processing. The implementation 
of our strategic over-the-counter derivatives 
processing platform has promoted a 30% 
increase in portfolio volume and a more 
than 50% decrease in cost per trade in four 
years. The platform now settles $2.2 trillion 
of derivative notionals each day and has 
been instrumental in improving operational 
Why are you still in the mortgage business?
That is a valid question. The mortgage busi-
ness can be volatile and has experienced 
increasingly lower returns as new regula-
tions add both sizable costs and higher 
capital requirements. In addition, it is not 
just the cost of the new rules in origination 
and servicing, it is the enormous complexity 
of those new requirements that can lead 
to problems and errors. It is now virtually 
impossible not to make some mistakes – and 
as you know, the price for making an error is 
very high. So why do we want to stay in this 
business? Here’s why:
delivery, control and client service, as demon-
strated by a more than 60% reduction in 
cash settlement breaks and a 50% increase in 
straight-through processing of equity deriva-
tives confirmations.
In all these cases, greater operational efficien-
cies and higher straight-through processing 
drive lower costs and lead to happy clients. 
We also continue to make investments in 
research and the coverage of clients. A couple 
of examples will suffice:
Research platform. We continue our research 
investments both in the quality of our 
people and in the number of companies 
and sectors we cover. In 2015, we expanded 
our global equity research coverage to 
more than 3,700 companies, the broadest 
equity company coverage platform among 
our competitors. With material increases 
in the United States – we expanded sector 
coverage in energy, banks, insurance and 
industrials – and in China, we doubled our 
A-share coverage. 
Increased Investment Banking coverage. We are 
actively recruiting and hiring senior bankers 
in areas where we were either underpen-
etrated or where there has been incremental 
secular growth, such as energy, technology, 
healthcare and Greater China. 
• Mortgages are important to our customers. 
For most of our customers, their home is 
the single largest purchase they will make 
in their lifetime. More than that, it is an 
emotional purchase – it is where they 
are getting their start, raising a family or 
maybe spending their retirement years. 
As a bank that wants to build lifelong 
relationships with its customers, we want 
to be there for them at life’s most critical 
junctures. Mortgages are important to our 
customers, and we still believe that we 
have the brand and scale to build a higher-
quality and less volatile mortgage business.
35
36
• Originations. We reduced our product set 
from 37 to 15, we will complete the rollout 
of a new originations system, and we will 
continue to leverage digital channels to 
make the application process easier for 
our customers and more efficient for us. 
In addition, we have dramatically reduced 
Federal Housing Administration (FHA) 
originations. Currently, it simply is too 
costly and too risky to originate these 
kinds of mortgages. Part of the risk comes 
from the penalties that the government 
charges if you make a mistake – and 
part of the risk is because these types of 
mortgages default frequently. And in the 
new world, the cost of default servicing is 
extraordinarily high.
• Servicing. If we had our druthers, we 
would never service a defaulted mortgage 
again. We do not want to be in the busi-
ness of foreclosure because it is exceed-
ingly painful for our customers, and it is 
difficult, costly and painful to us and our 
reputation. In part, by making fewer FHA 
loans, we have helped reduce our foreclo-
sure inventory by more than 80%, and 
we are negotiating arrangements with 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to have any 
delinquent mortgages insured by them be 
serviced by them.
• Community Reinvestment Act and Fair 
Lending. Finally, while making fewer FHA 
loans can make it more difficult to meet 
our Community Reinvestment Act and 
Fair Lending obligations, we believe we 
have solutions in place to responsibly 
meet these obligations – both the more 
subjective requirements and the quantita-
tive components – without unduly jeopar-
dizing our company.

V. WE HAVE ALWAYS SUPPORTED OUR COMMUNITIES
Most large companies are outstanding corpo-
rate citizens – and they have been for a long 
time. They compensate their people fairly, 
they provide critical medical and retirement 
plans, and they’re in the forefront of social 
policy; for example, in staffing a diverse 
You seem to be doing more and more to support your communities — how and why?
Since our founding in New York more than 
200 years ago, JPMorgan Chase and its 
predecessor banks have been leaders in their 
communities. This is nothing new. For 
example, in April 1906, J.P. Morgan & Co. 
made Wall Street’s largest contribution 
– $25,000 – to, as The New York Times 
described it at the time, “extend practical 
sympathy to the stricken people of San 
Francisco.” This was two days after the 
earthquake that destroyed 80% of the city 
and killed 3,000 people. In February 2016, we 
played much the same role when the firm 
and our employees contributed hundreds of 
thousands of dollars to pay for medical 
services for children exposed to lead in the 
Flint, Michigan, water crisis. And over the 
last several years, we have given more than 
$20 million to help in the aftermath of 
natural disasters, from tsunamis in Asia to 
Superstorm Sandy in the northeast United 
States (and it was gratifying to see how 
employees rallied with their time and with 
the full resources of the firm to help). 
workforce, hiring veterans and effectively 
training people for jobs. They, like all institu-
tions, are not perfect, but they try their best 
to obey the spirit and the letter of the laws of 
the land in which they operate.
In addition to our annual philanthropic 
giving – which now totals over $200 million 
a year – we are putting our resources, the 
expertise of our business leaders, our data, 
relationships and knowledge of global 
markets into significant efforts aimed at 
boosting economic growth and expanding 
opportunity for those being left behind in 
today’s economy. We have made long-term 
global commitments to workforce readi-
ness, getting small businesses the capital 
and support they need to grow, improving 
consumer financial health and supporting 
strong urban economies. You can read more 
detail about these programs on pages 71-72. 
And in the sidebars in this section, you can 
hear directly from some of our partners 
about our efforts. We think these initia-
tives will make a significant contribution 
to creating more economic opportunity for 
more people around the world.
In particular, I want to tell you about an 
exciting new community service program 
we have developed that is capitalizing on our 
most important resource – the talent of our 
people. The Service Corps program recruits 
top-performing employees from around the 
world to put their skills and expertise to 
work on behalf of nonprofit partners that 
are helping to build stronger communities. 
This program, combining leadership devel-
opment with philanthropic purpose, started 
small in Brazil, grew into the Detroit Service 
Corps as part of our investment there, and 
has now spread across the globe, with proj-
ects in Africa, Asia, and North and South 
37
38
America. Service Corps employees work 
on-site with nonprofits on projects that last 
three weeks. In total, 64 people have been 
involved in 22 projects. And this program 
will continue to grow in the coming years 
to other domestic and international loca-
tions. While supporting our nonprofit 
partners to deliver on their mission, our 
employees also gain enormous satisfaction 
and sense of purpose from the opportunity 
to help. In addition, as they travel across 
the globe and interact with their peers, 
they develop a great, permanent camara-
derie that helps unite our employees from 
around the world in a commitment to 
make a difference in our communities. 
 
 
PARTNERSHIP IN DETROIT  
by Mayor Mike Duggan
   
Detroit is coming back. After years of challenges, we are 
seeing signs of real progress in our neighborhoods and  
business districts. 
Two years into our administration, we’ve brought back fiscal 
discipline and have balanced the city’s budget for the first time 
in more than a decade. We’ve installed 61,000 new LED street-
lights in our neighborhoods. Buses are running on schedule 
for the first time in 20 years and are serving 100,000 more 
riders each week. We’ve taken down nearly 8,000 blighted 
homes and, as a result, are seeing double-digit property value 
increases across the majority of the city. Perhaps most impor-
tant, 8,000 more Detroiters are working today than two years 
ago, thanks to efforts to attract new investment and develop 
our workforce. 
None of these positive steps would have been possible without 
the partnerships we’ve established in Washington, D.C., in 
our state capital of Lansing, with the Detroit City Council, and 
especially with our residents and partners in the business and 
philanthropic communities. 
When our friends at JPMorgan Chase started thinking about 
making a $100 million investment in Detroit, they started off 
by asking about our priorities for the city’s recovery — not just 
mine but those of our community and philanthropic leaders 
as well. Today, we can see the impact of JPMorgan Chase’s 
commitment to Detroit in many places — in the opening of a 
new grocery store in the Westside’s Harmony Village neigh-
borhood, in the minority-led small businesses that are getting 
much-needed capital from the new Entrepreneurs of Color Fund 
and in the map of Detroit’s workforce system that is helping 
us prepare Detroiters for the new jobs coming to the city. 
JPMorgan Chase is bringing its data, expertise and talent to this 
town in so many ways — assets that are just as important as 
money in boosting our recovery.
The partnerships JPMorgan Chase saw at work in Detroit helped 
give the firm confidence to invest so significantly in our city. 
And because we have this fine company at the table, we now 
have other companies coming to our city looking to contribute 
and invest in Detroit and its residents.
We still have a long way to go. But with great partners like 
JPMorgan Chase, we are creating a turnaround that is bene-
fiting all Detroiters and can be a model for other large cities 
facing similar challenges.

CREATING CAREER-FOCUSED EDUCATION  
by Freeman A. Hrabowski III, President of the University of 
Maryland, Baltimore County 
 
Too many people are left out of work or are stuck in low-wage, 
low-skill jobs without a path to meaningful employment and the 
chance to get ahead. Among young people, this truly is a national 
tragedy: More than 5 million young Americans, including one in 
five African-American and one in six Latino youths, are neither 
attending school nor working. JPMorgan Chase’s New Skills for 
Youth initiative is an important example of educators and busi-
ness leaders partnering to equip young people with the skills and 
experience to be career ready. 
The social and economic hurdles faced by young people of color and 
those who come from low-income families have been exacerbated 
by the growing crisis of high inner city unemployment and low high 
school graduation rates. With too many young people marginalized, 
economic growth slows, and social challenges increase. The public 
and private sectors must work together to change this. 
Educators need to emphasize both college and career readiness. 
They need to recognize that there is growing demand for technically 
trained, middle-skill workers — from robotics technicians to licensed 
practical nurses — and better align what they teach with the talent 
needs of employers. At the same time, business leaders need to 
support the education system as it strives to teach today’s skills and 
help students develop into critical thinkers. 
A bachelor’s degree is as important as ever, and universities must 
do more to support students of all backgrounds who arrive on our 
campuses. However, we need to recognize that not all college and 
career pathways include pursuing a four-year degree immediately, 
and we need to eliminate the stigma attached to alternate paths. 
High-quality, rigorous career and technical education programs 
can connect people to high-skill, well-paying jobs — and they 
don’t preclude earning a four-year degree down the road. Classes 
dedicated to robotics, medical science, mechanics and coding build 
skills that employers desperately need. They also prepare students 
to land great jobs. 
Recent education reforms are making progress, but we still need 
greater focus on preparing young people, from all income levels, 
with the skills and experiences to be college and career ready. 
The public and private sectors need to forge deeper relation-
ships and make greater investments in developing and expanding 
effective models of career-focused education that are aligned 
with the needs of emerging industries. This is an investment 
not only in growing our economy but also in providing more of 
our young people with a tangible path out of poverty and a real 
chance at economic success. 
COMMITMENT TO OUR VETS  
by Stan McChrystal, Retired General, U.S. Army
   
In early 2011, two employees of JPMorgan Chase came to 
wintry New Haven, Connecticut, to talk about veterans. 
Specifically, they told me that Jamie Dimon felt the bank 
could, and should, do more to help the many veterans 
returning from service — many who were in Iraq and 
Afghanistan — take their rightful place in civilian society. 
Since 9/11, the military had enjoyed tremendous support 
from the American people, but seemingly intractable 
problems of reintegration, particularly challenges with 
meaningful employment, haunted an embarrassingly large 
number of former warriors and their families.
I listened with interest and no small amount of cautious 
skepticism. I was aware of countless programs initiated 
with the best of intentions that soon became more talk 
than action and was worried this might be the same. The 
JPMorgan Chase people asked if I thought the bank should 
create a program to help veterans find employment and if 
the bank did start such a program, would I join the advisory 
council for it. 
I thought for a moment and then responded: “If Jamie 
is seriously willing to commit the bank to the effort,” I 
replied, “it’s the right thing to do, and I’m in. If not, there 
are other, far less ambitious ways to offer the bank’s help 
for veterans.” As we talked further, they convinced me that 
Jamie, and the full energy that JPMorgan Chase could bring, 
would be behind the effort.
That was almost five years ago, and JPMorgan Chase has 
surpassed my every hope and expectation. By committing 
full-time talent and including the personal involvement of 
senior leadership, the firm has been the strongest force 
in veterans’ employment in America. The Veteran Jobs 
Mission program has not only implemented truly cutting-
edge programs inside the bank to recruit, train, mentor 
and develop veterans — resulting in an increase of more 
than 10,000 veterans within the bank since 2011 — but the 
program also has demonstrated the power of commitment. 
An impressive number of American businesses have set and 
met employment goals (to date, over 300,000 veterans have 
been hired collectively, with a goal of hiring 1 million) that 
would have been considered unattainable at the start.

VI.  A SAFE, STRONG BANKING INDUSTRY IS ABSOLUTELY 
CRITICAL TO A COUNTRY’S SUCCESS — BANKS’ ROLES 
HAVE CHANGED, BUT THEY WILL NEVER BE A UTILITY 
For the people of a country to thrive, you 
need a successful economy and markets. For 
an economy to be successful, it is an absolute 
necessity to have a healthy and successful 
banking system. The United States has a 
large, vibrant financial system, from asset 
managers and private equity sponsors to 
hedge funds, non-banks, venture capital-
ists, public and private market participants, 
small to large investors and banks. Banks are 
at the core of the system. They educate the 
world about companies and markets, they 
syndicate credit and market risk, they hold 
and move money and assets, and they neces-
sarily create discipline among borrowers and 
transparency in the market. To do this well, 
America needs all different kinds of financial 
institutions and all different kinds of banks – 
large and small. 
There is a great need for the services of all 
banks, from large global banks to smaller 
regional and community banks. That said, 
our large, global Corporate & Investment 
Bank does things that regional and commu-
nity banks simply cannot do. We offer 
unique capabilities to large corporations, 
large investors and governments, including 
federal institutions, states and cities. 
Only large banks can bank large institutions.
Of the 26 million businesses in the United 
States, only 4,000 are public companies. 
While accounting for less than 0.02% of all 
firms, these companies represent one-third  
of private sector employment and almost 
half of the total $2.3 trillion of business 
capital expenditures. And most are multi-
nationals doing business in many countries 
around the world. In addition to corpora-
tions, governments and government insti-
tutions – such as central banks and sover-
eign wealth funds – need financial services. 
The financial needs of all these institutions 
are extraordinary. We provide many of 
the services they require. For example, we 
essentially maintain checking accounts for 
these institutions in many countries and 
currencies. We provide extensive credit lines 
or raise capital for these clients, often in 
multiple jurisdictions and in multiple curren-
cies. On an average day, JPMorgan Chase 
Does the United States really need large banks?
moves approximately $5 trillion for these 
types of institutions, raises or lends $6 billion 
of capital for these institutions, and buys or 
sells approximately $1.5 trillion of securities 
to serve investors and issuers. We do all this 
efficiently and safely for our clients. In addi-
tion, as a firm, we spend approximately $700 
million a year on research so that we can 
educate investors, institutions and govern-
ments about economies, markets and compa-
nies. For countries, we raised $60 billion 
of capital in 2015. We help these nations 
develop their capital markets, get ratings 
from ratings agencies and, in general, expand 
their knowledge. The fact is that almost 
everything we do is because clients want and 
need our various services. 
Put “large” in context. 
While we are a large bank, it might surprise 
you to know two facts: (1) The assets of all 
banks in the United States are a much smaller 
part of the country’s economy, relatively, than 
in most other large, developed countries; and 
(2) America’s top five banks by assets are 
smaller, relatively, to total banking assets in 
America than in most other large, developed 
countries. As shown in the following charts, 
this framework means banks in the United 
States are less consolidated.

Our size and our diversification make us stronger.
Our large and diversified earnings streams 
and good margins create a strong base of 
earnings that can withstand many different 
crises. Stock analysts have pointed out that 
JPMorgan Chase has among the lowest 
earnings volatility and revenue volatility 
among all banks. This strength is what 
allows us to invest in countries to support 
our clients and to have the staying power to 
survive tough times. We are a port of safety 
in almost any storm.
Finally, our size gives us the ability to make 
large and innovative investments that are 
often needed to create new products and 
services or to improve our efficiency. The  
ultimate beneficiary of all this is our clients.
Community banks are critical to the country — 
large banks provide essential services to them.  
(I prepared this section initially as an op-ed 
article, but I’d like you to see it in total.)
Not long ago, I read some commentary 
excoriating big banks written by the CEO 
of a regional bank. The grievances weren’t 
new or surprising – in the current climate, 
one doesn’t have to look far to find someone 
attacking large financial institutions. But I 
recognized this particular bank as a client 
of ours. So I did some digging. It turns out 
that our firms have a relationship that goes 
back many years and spans a broad range of 
services. And it struck me how powerful the 
incentive is, in today’s heated public dialogue, 
to frame issues as a winner-take-all fight 
between opposing interests: big vs. small. 
Main Street vs. Wall Street. It is a simple 
narrative, and while banks of all sizes make 
mistakes, certainly a key lesson of the crisis 
is that mistakes at the largest institutions can 
impact the broader financial system. 
But, as is often the case, reality tells a deeper 
story, and the U.S. financial services industry 
does not conform to simple narratives. It is a 
complex ecosystem that depends on diverse 
business models co-existing because there 
is no other way to effectively serve Ameri-
ca’s vast array of customers and clients. A 
healthy banking system depends on institu-
tions of all sizes to drive innovation, build 
and support our financial infrastructure, and 
provide the essential services that support 
the U.S. economy and allow it to thrive. 
In our system, smaller regional and commu-
nity banks play an indispensable role. These 
institutions sit close to the communities 
they serve. Their highest-ranking corporate 
officers live in the same neighborhoods as 
their clients. They are able to forge deep and 
long-standing relationships and bring a keen 
knowledge of the local economy and culture. 
They frequently are able to provide high-
touch and specialized banking services, given 
their unique connection to their communities.

Large banks such as JPMorgan Chase also 
have a strong local presence. We are proud 
to have branches and offices all across 
the country and to have the privilege of 
being woven into communities large and 
small. But we respect the fact that for 
some customers, there is no substitute 
for a locally based bank and that in some 
markets, a locally based lender is the best  
fit for the needs of the community. 
Having said that, these very same regional 
and community banks depend on large 
banks such as ours to make their service 
offerings possible. First, large banks offer 
vital correspondent banking services for 
smaller institutions. These services include 
distributing and collecting physical cash, 
processing checks and clearing international 
payments. JPMorgan Chase alone extends 
such services to 339 small banks and 10 
corporate credit unions across the country. 
Last year, we provided these institutions with 
$4.7 billion in intraday credit to facilitate 
cash management activities and processed 
$7.6 trillion in payments/receivables. 
Large banks also enable community banks to 
provide traditional mortgages by purchasing 
the mortgages that smaller banks originate, 
selling the loans to the agencies (e.g., Fannie 
Mae) or capital markets and continuing to 
service the borrower. In 2015, JPMorgan 
Chase purchased $10.4 billion in such resi-
dential loans from 165 banks nationwide.
In addition to these correspondent banking 
services, large banks deliver mission-critical 
investment banking services. This includes 
helping smaller banks access debt and equity 
capital, supporting them through strategic 
combinations, enabling them to manage 
their securities portfolios, providing valuable 
risk management tools (such as interest rate 
swaps and foreign exchange), creating syndi-
cated credit facilities that smaller banks’ 
clients can participate in and offering direct 
financing. JPMorgan Chase has raised $16.2 
billion in growth equity capital for smaller 
banks since 2014; advised on strategic 
combinations among regional and commu-
nity banks valued at $52 billion; and, last 
year, provided $5.3 billion in secured repo 
financing, extended $1.4 billion in trading 
line financing and provided $7 billion in 
other unsecured financing to hundreds of 
banks nationwide. 
This is a story of symbiosis among our banks 
rather than a binary choice between big and 
small. Yes, all banks are competitors in the 
marketplace. But marketplace competition 
is not zero-sum. In banking, your compet-
itor can also be your customer. Large banks 
ultimately would be diminished if regional 
and community banks were weakened, and, 
just as surely, those smaller institutions 
would lose out if America’s large banks were 
hobbled. We require a system that serves 
the needs of all Americans, from customers 
getting their first mortgage to farmers and 
small business owners to our largest multina-
tional companies.
America faces enough real challenges 
without inventing conflict where none 
need exist. Rather, banks of all sizes do 
themselves and their stakeholders better 
service by acknowledging the specific value 
different types of institutions offer. Then we 
all can get on with the business of serving 
our distinctive roles in strengthening the 
economy, our communities and our country. 
Banks cannot be utilities.
Utilities are monopolies; i.e., generally only 
one company is operating in a market. And 
because of that, prices and returns are regu-
lated. Banks do not have the same relation-
ship with their clients as most other compa-
nies do. When a customer walks into a store 
and wants to buy an item, the store sells it. 
By contrast, very often a bank needs to turn 
a customer down; for example, in connec-
tion with a credit card or a loan. Responsible 
lending is good, but irresponsible lending 
is bad for the economy and for the client 
(we clearly experienced this in the Great 
Recession). Banks are more like partners 
with their clients – and they are often active 
participants in their clients’ financial affairs. 
They frequently are in the position where 
they have to insist that clients operate with 
discipline – by asking for collateral, putting 
43
43
covenants in place or forcing the sale of 
assets. This does not always create friends, 
but it is critical for appropriate lending and 
the proper functioning of markets. Banks 
have to continuously make judgments on 
risk, and appropriately price for it, and they 
have to do this while competing for a client’s 
business. There is nothing about banking 
that remotely resembles a utility.
America’s financial system is the finest the world 
has ever seen — let’s ensure it stays that way.
The position of America’s leading banks 
is like many other U.S. industries – they 
are among the global leaders. If we are not 
allowed to compete, we will become less 
diversified and less efficient. I do not want 
any American to look back in 20 years and 
try to figure out how and why America’s 
banks lost the leadership position in finan-
cial services. If not us, it will be someone 
else and likely a Chinese bank. Today, many 
Chinese banks already are larger than we 
are, and they continue to grow rapidly. They 
are ambitious, they are supported by their 
government and they have a competitive 
reason to go global – the Chinese banks 
are following and supporting their Chinese 
companies with the financial services that 
are required to expand abroad. 
Not only are America’s largest banks global 
leaders, but they help set global standards for 
financial markets, companies, and even coun-
tries and controls (such as anti-money laun-
dering). Finally, banks bring huge resources 
– financial and knowledge – to America’s 
major flagship companies and investors, 
thereby helping them maintain their global 
leadership positions.
Why do you say that banks need to be steadfast and always there for their clients — doesn’t  
that always put you in the middle of the storm?
Yes, to an extent. When an economy 
weakens, banks will see it in lower busi-
ness volumes and higher credit losses. Of 
course, we want to manage this carefully, 
but it is part of the cost of doing business. 
Building a banking business takes decades 
of training bankers, nurturing relation-
ships, opening branches and developing 
the proper technology. It is not like buying 
or selling a stock. Clients, from consumers 
to countries, expect you to be there in both 
good times and the toughest of times. Banks 
and their services are often the essential 
lifeblood to their clients. Therefore, it is part 
of the cost of doing business to manage 
through the cycles. 
JPMorgan Chase consistently supports 
consumers, businesses and communities in 
both good times and the toughest of times. In 
2015, the firm provided $22 billion of credit 
to U.S. small businesses, which allowed them 
to develop new products, expand operations 
and hire more workers; $168 billion of credit 
to Commercial and Middle Market clients; 
$233 billion of credit to consumers; more 
than $68 billion of credit or capital raised for 
nonprofit and government entities, including 
states, municipalities, hospitals and universi-
ties; and $1.4 trillion of credit or capital raised 
for corporations. In total, we extended credit 
and raised capital of more than $2 trillion for 
our clients.
Banks were there for their clients, particularly 
when the capital markets were not — we need this 
to continue.
The public markets, even though they are 
populated with a lot of very bright and 
talented people, are surprisingly fickle. The 
psychology and wisdom of crowds are not 
always rational, and they are very imper-
sonal. People who buy and sell securities 
do not have a moral obligation to provide 
credit to clients. This is when banks’ long-
term relationships and fairly consistent

pricing and credit offerings are needed the 
most. The chart below shows how banks 
continued to be there for their clients as the 
markets were not. 
Corporations get the vital credit they need 
by issuing securities, including commercial 
paper, or by borrowing from banks. You can 
see in the chart below the dramatic drop in 
the issuance of securities and commercial 
paper once the financial crisis hit. Commer-
cial paper outstanding alone dropped by 
$1 trillion, starving companies in desperate 
need of cash. You can see that bank loans 
outstanding, for the most part, were steady 
and consistent. This means that banks 
continued to renew or roll over credit to their 
clients – small, medium and large – when it 
was needed the most.
This will be a little bit harder to do in 
the future because capital, liquidity and 
accounting rules are essentially more procy-
clical than they were in the past. We esti-
mate that if we were to enter a very difficult 
market, such as 2008, our capital needs could 
increase by 10%. Despite the market need for 
credit, banks would be in a position where, 
all things being equal, they would need to 
reduce the credit extended to maintain their 
own strong capital positions.

Most banks actually are trusted by their 
clients, but generically, they are not. This 
dichotomy also is true with politicians, 
lawyers and the media – people trust the 
individuals they know, but when it comes 
to whether people trust them as a group, 
they do not. We believe that the only way to 
be restored to a position of trust is to earn 
it every day in every community and with 
every client. 
The reality is that banks, because of the disci-
plined role they sometimes have to play and 
the need to say no in some instances, will not 
always be the best of friends with some of 
their clients. But banks still need to discharge 
that responsibility while continuing to regain 
a position of trust in society. There is no easy, 
simple answer other than:
• Maintain steadfast, consistent and trans-
parent behavior wherever they operate.
• Communicate honestly, clearly and 
consistently.
• Deliver great products and services.
• Admitting to mistakes is good, fixing 
them is better and learning from them is 
essential. 
• Make it easy for customers to deal with you 
– particularly when they have problems.
• Work with customers who are struggling – 
both individuals and companies.
• Focus on the customer and treat all clients 
the way you would want to be treated. 
• Be great citizens in the community.  
Establish strong relationships with govern-
ments and civic society.
• Treat regulators like full partners – and 
accept that you will not always agree. 
When they make a change in regulations, 
even ones you don’t like, accept them and 
move on.
• As an industry, make fewer mistakes and 
behave better – the bad behavior of one 
individual reverberates and affects the 
entire industry.
Finally, strong regulators and stronger 
standards for banks must ultimately mean 
that banks are meeting more rigorous stan-
dards. Every bank is doing everything in its 
power to meet regulatory standards. It has 
been eight years since the financial crisis 
and six years since Dodd-Frank. Regulators 
should take more credit for the extraordi-
nary amount that has been accomplished 
and should state this clearly to the American 
public. This should help improve consumer 
confidence in the banking system – and 
in the economy in general. Consumer and 
business confidence is the secret sauce for a 
healthy economy. It is free, and it would be 
good to sprinkle a bit more of it around. 
Are you and your regulators thinking more comprehensively and in a forward-looking way to 
play a role in helping to accelerate global growth? 
By any reasonable measure, the financial 
system is unquestionably stronger, and regu-
lators deserve a lot of credit for this. But it 
also is true that thousands of rules, regula-
tions and requirements were made – and 
needed to be made – quickly. The political 
and regulatory side wanted it done swiftly 
to ensure that events that happened in the 
Great Recession would never happen again. 
But now is the time when we can and should 
look at everything more deliberately and 
assess whether recent reforms have generated 
unintended consequences that merit attention. 
Some people speak of regulation like it is a 
simple, binary tradeoff – a stronger system 
or slower growth or vice versa. We believe 
that many times you can come up with 
regulations that do both – create a stronger 
system and enhance growth. 
Will banks ever regain a position of trust? How will this be done?

There will be a time to comprehensively review, 
coordinate and modify regulations to ensure 
maximum safety, create more efficiency and 
accelerate economic growth.
Every major piece of legislation in the United 
States that was large and complex has been 
revisited at some point with the intention of 
making it better. The political time for this 
is not now, but we should do so for banking 
regulations someday. We are not looking 
to rewrite or to start over at all – just some 
modifications that make sense. Here are a 
few specific examples: 
• Liquidity. Regulators could give them-
selves more tools for adjusting liquidity 
to accommodate market needs. This could 
be done with modest changes that could 
actually ameliorate the procyclical nature 
of the current rules and, in my opinion, 
enhance safety and soundness and 
improve the economy.
• Mortgages. Finishing and simplifying mort-
gage rules around origination, servicing, 
capital requirements and securitizations 
would help create a more active mortgage 
market at a lower cost to customers and, 
again, at no risk to safety and soundness 
if done right. This, too, would be a plus to 
consumers and the economy.
• Capital rules. Without reducing total 
capital levels, capital rules could be 
modified to be less procyclical, which 
could serve to both dampen a bubble and 
soften a bust. This alone could boost the 
economy and reduce overall economic 
risk. There are also some rules – for 
example, requiring that capital be held 
against a deposit at the Federal Reserve – 
that distort the normal functioning of the 
market. These could be eliminated with 
no risk to safety and soundness unless 
you think the Fed is a risky investment. 
Finally, finishing the capital rules for 
banks will remove one additional drag on 
the banks and allow for more consistent 
capital planning. This would also help to 
improve confidence in the banks and, by 
extension, investor confidence.
• Increased coordination among regulators. 
Having five, six or seven regulators 
involved in every issue does make things 
more complicated, expensive and inef-
ficient, not just for banks but for regula-
tors, too. This slows policymaking and 
rulemaking and is one reason why many 
of the rules still have not been completed. 
One of the lessons we have all learned is 
that policymakers need to move quickly 
in a crisis. While everyone has worked 
hard to be more coordinated, far more 
can be done. 
• Be more forward looking. This is already 
happening. As banks are catching up on 
regulatory demands, the pace of change, 
while still rapid, is slowing. This sets the 
stage for both banks and regulators to be 
able to devote more resources to increas-
ingly critical issues, including cyberse-
curity, digital services, data protection, 
FinTech and emerging risks.
As the financial system reaches the level of 
strength that regulations require, we hope 
banks can begin to expand slightly more 
rapidly (and, of course, responsibly) – both 
geographically and in terms of products and 
services – with the support and confidence 
of their regulators. This will also foster 
healthy economic growth, which we all so 
desperately want.

VII. GOOD PUBLIC POLICY IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT
Are you worried about bad public policy?
Yes, bad public policy, and I’m not looking 
at this in a partisan way, creates risk for 
the economies of the world and the living 
standards of the people on this planet – and, 
therefore, for the future of JPMorgan Chase – 
more so than credit or market risks. We have 
many real-life examples that demonstrate 
how essential good public policy is to the 
health and welfare of a country. 
East Germany vs. West Germany. After World 
War II, East Germany and West Germany 
were in equal positions, both having been 
devastated by the war. After the war, West 
Germany flourished, creating a vibrant 
and healthy country for its citizens. East 
Germany (and, in fact, most of Eastern 
Europe), operating under different gover-
nance and policies, was a complete disaster. 
This did not have to be the case. East 
Germany could have been just as successful 
as West Germany. This is a perfect example 
of how important policy is and also of how 
economics is not a zero-sum game. 
Argentina, Venezuela, Cuba, North Korea vs. 
Singapore, South Korea, Mexico. These coun-
tries also provide us with some pretty strong 
contrasts. The first four countries mentioned 
above have performed poorly economically. 
The last three mentioned above have done 
rather well in the last several decades. You 
cannot credit this failure or success to the 
existence of great natural resources because, 
on both sides, some had these resources, 
and some did not. It would take too long 
to articulate it fully here, but strong public 
policy – fiscal, monetary, social, etc. – made 
all the difference. The countries that did 
not perform well had many reasons to be 
successful, but, they were not. In almost all 
these cases, their government took ineffec-
tive actions in the name of the people. 
Detroit. Detroit is an example of failure at the 
city level. In the last 20 years, most American 
cities had a renaissance – Detroit did not. 
Detroit was a train wreck in slow motion 
for 20 years. The city had unsustainable 
finances, corrupt government and a declining 
population that went from 2 million resi-
dents to just over 750,000. It is tragic that 
this catastrophe had to happen before 
government started to rectify the situation. 
We have reported that we are making a huge 
investment in Detroit, and we are doing 
this because the leadership – the Demo-
cratic mayor and the Republican governor, 
working with business and nonprofit orga-
nizations – is taking rational and practical 
action in Detroit to fix the city’s problems. 
These leaders talk about strengthening the 
police, improving schools, bringing jobs 
back, creating affordable housing, fixing 
streetlights and rehabilitating neighborhoods 
– real things that actually matter and will 
help the people of Detroit. They do not couch 
their agenda in sanctimonious ideology. 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These are examples 
of poor policy at the industry and company 
level. Under government auspices and with 
federal government urging, Fannie and 
Freddie became the largest, most lever-
aged and most speculative vehicles that the 
world had ever seen. And when they finally 
collapsed, they cost the U.S. government 
$189 billion. Their actions were a critical 
part of the failure of the mortgage market, 
which was at the heart of the Great Reces-
sion. Many people spent time trying to figure 
out who was to blame more – the banks and 
mortgage brokers involved or Fannie and 
Freddie. Here is a better course – each should 
have acknowledged its mistakes and deter-
mined what could have been done better.
So yes, public policy is critical to a healthy 
and functioning economy. Now I’d like to 
turn my attention to a more forward-looking 
view of some of the potential risks out there 
today that are driven by public policy:
49
49
Our current inability to work together in 
addressing important, long-term issues. We 
have spoken many times about the extraor-
dinarily positive and resilient American 
economy. Today, it is growing stronger, and it 
is far better than you hear in the current polit-
ical discourse. But we have serious issues that 
we need to address – even the United States 
does not have a divine right to success. I won’t 
go into a lot of detail but will list only some 
key concerns: the long-term fiscal and tax 
issues (driven mostly by healthcare and Social 
Security costs, as well as complex and poorly 
designed corporate and individual taxes), 
immigration, education (especially in inner 
city schools) and the need for good, long-
term infrastructure plans. I am not pointing 
fingers at the government in particular for our 
inability to act because it is all of us, as U.S. 
citizens, who need to face these problems. 
I do not believe that these issues will cause a 
crisis in the next five to 10 years, and, unfor-
tunately, this may lull us into a false sense 
of security. But after 10 years, it will become 
clear that action will need to be taken. The 
problem is not that the U.S. economy won’t 
be able to take care of its citizens – it is that 
taking away benefits, creating intergenera-
tional warfare and scapegoating will make 
for very difficult and bad politics. This is a 
tragedy that we can see coming. Early action 
would be relatively painless.
The potential exit of Britain from the European 
Union (Brexit). One can reasonably argue that 
Britain is better untethered to the bureau-
cratic and sometimes dysfunctional European 
Union. This may be true in the long run, but 
let’s analyze the risks. We mostly know what 
it looks like if Britain stays in the European 
Union – effectively, a continuation of a more 
predictable environment. But the range of 
outcomes of a Brexit is large and potentially 
unknown. The best case is that Britain can 
quickly renegotiate hundreds of trade and 
other contracts with countries around the 
world including the European Union. Even 
this scenario will result in years of uncer-
tainty, and this uncertainty will hurt the 
economies of both Britain and the European 
Union. In a bad scenario, and this is not the 
worst-case scenario, trade retaliation against 
Britain by countries in the European Union 
is possible, even though this would not be 
in their own self-interest. Retaliation would 
make things even worse for the British and 
European economies. And it is hard to deter-
mine if the long-run impact would strengthen 
the European Union or cause it to break 
apart. The European Union began with a 
collective resolve to establish a political union 
and peace after centuries of devastating wars 
and to create a common market that would 
result in a better economy and greater pros-
perity for its citizens. These two goals still 
exist, and they are still worth striving for. 
We need a proper public policy response to 
technology, trade and globalization. Technology 
and globalization are the best things that ever 
happened to mankind, but we need to help 
those left behind. Technology is what has 
driven progress for all mankind. Without 
it, we all would be living in tents, hunting 
buffalo and hoping to live to age 40. From 
printing, which resulted in the dissemina-
tion of information, to agriculture and to 
today’s computers and healthcare – it’s an 
astounding phenomenon – and the next 
100 years will be just as astounding.
The world and most people benefit enor-
mously from innovative ideas; however, 
some people, some communities and 
some sectors in our economy do not. As 
we embrace progress, we need to recog-
nize that technology and globalization can 
impact labor markets negatively, create job 
displacement, and contribute to the pay 
disparity between the skilled and unskilled. 
Political and business leaders have fallen 
short in not only acknowledging these chal-
lenges but in dealing with them head on. 
We need to support solutions that address 
the displacement of workers and communi-
ties through better job training, relocation 
support and income assistance. Some have 
suggested that dramatically expanding the 
earned income tax credit (effectively, paying 
people to work) may create a healthy and 
more egalitarian society. Also, we must 
address an education system that fails 
millions of young people who live in poor 
communities throughout the United States.

The answer to these challenges is not to 
hold back progress and the magic of tech-
nology; the answer is to deal with the facts 
and ensure that public policy and public 
and private enterprise contribute to a 
healthy, functioning and inclusive economy.
At JPMorgan Chase, we are trying to 
contribute to the debate on public policy. 
One new way we are doing this is through 
the development of our JPMorgan Chase 
Institute, which aims to support sounder 
economic and public policy through better 
facts, timely data and thoughtful analysis. 
Our work at the Institute, whether analyzing 
income and consumption volatility, small 
businesses, local spending by consumers or 
the impact of low gas prices, aims to inform 
policymakers, businesses and nonprofit 
leaders and help them make smarter deci-
sions to advance global prosperity.
What works and what doesn’t work.
In my job, I am fortunate to be able to travel 
around the world and to meet presidents, 
prime ministers, chief executive officers, 
nonprofit directors and other influential civic 
leaders. All of them want a better future for 
their country and their people. What I have 
learned from them is that while politics is 
hard (in my view, much harder than busi-
ness), breeding mistrust and misunder-
standing makes the political environment far 
worse. Nearly always, collaboration, rational 
thinking and analysis make the situation 
better. Solutions are not always easy to find, 
but they almost always are there. 
What doesn’t work: 
• Treating every decision like it is binary – 
my way or your way. Most decisions are 
not binary, and there are usually better 
answers waiting to be found if you do the 
analysis and involve the right people. 
• Drawing straw men or creating scape-
goats. These generally are subtle attempts 
to oversimplify someone’s position in 
order to attack it, resulting in anger, 
misunderstanding and mistrust.
• Denigrating a whole class of people or 
society. This is always wrong and just 
another form of prejudice. One of the 
greatest men in America’s history, Presi-
dent Abraham Lincoln, never drew straw 
men, never scapegoated and never deni-
grated any class of society – even though 
he probably had more reason to do so 
than many. In the same breath, some of 
our politicians can extol his virtues  
while violating them. 
• Equating perception with reality. This is a 
tough one because you have to deal with 
both perceptions and reality. However, 
perceptions that are real are completely 
different from perceptions that are false. 
And how you deal with each of them prob-
ably should differ. 
• Treating someone’s comments as if 
they were complaints. When someone’s 
response to an issue raised is “here they 
go complaining again,” that reaction 
diminishes the point of view and also 
diminishes the person. When a person 
complains, you need to ask the question: 
“Are they right or are they wrong?” (If you 
don’t like the person’s attitude, that is a 
different matter.) 
What does work:
• Collaborating and compromising. They 
are a necessity in a democracy. Also, you 
can compromise without violating your 
principles, but it is nearly impossible to 
compromise when you turn principles 
into ideology. 
• Listening carefully to each other. Make 
an effort to understand when someone 
is right and acknowledge it. Each of us 
should read and listen to great thinkers 
who have an alternative point of view. 
• Constantly, openly and thoroughly 
reviewing institutions, programs and 
policies. Analyze what is working and 
what is not working, and then figure out – 
together – how we can make it better.

I am honored to work at this company and with its outstanding 
people. What they have accomplished during these often difficult 
circumstances has been extraordinary. I know that if you could see 
our people up close in action, you would join me in expressing deep 
gratitude to them. I am proud to be their partner.

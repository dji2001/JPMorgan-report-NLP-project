Jamie Dimon,  
Chairman and  
Chief Executive 
Officer
Dear Fellow Shareholders,
We are facing challenges at every turn: a pandemic, unprecedented government 
actions, a strong recovery after a sharp and deep global recession, a highly 
polarized U.S. election, mounting inflation, a war in Ukraine and dramatic  
economic sanctions against Russia. While all this turmoil has serious ramifica-
tions on our company, its effect on the world — with the extreme suffering of  
the Ukrainian people and the potential restructuring of the global order — is far 
more important. 
Adding to the disruption, these events are unfolding while America remains 
divided within its borders, with many arguing that it has lost its essential leader-
ship role outside of its borders and around the world. But during this difficult 
time, we have a moment to put aside our differences, offer solutions and work 
with others in the Western world to come together in defense of democracy and 
2
essential freedoms, including free enterprise. We have seen America, in partner-
ship with other countries around the globe, come together previously during 
instances of conflict and crisis. This juncture is also a moment when our country 
needs to work across the private and public sectors to lead once again by, 
among other remediations, improving American competitiveness and better ful-
filling equal access to opportunity for all. JPMorgan Chase, a company that has 
historically worked across borders and boundaries, will do its part to ensure the 
global economy is safe and secure. I discuss these themes later in this letter.
Although I begin this annual letter to shareholders in a challenging landscape,  
I remain proud of what our company and our hundreds of thousands of employ-
ees around the world have achieved, collectively and individually. As you know, 
we have long championed the essential role of banking in a community — its 
potential for bringing people together, for enabling companies and individuals to 
reach for their dreams, and for being a source of strength in difficult times. 
Throughout these past two challenging years, we never stopped doing all the 
things we should be doing to serve our clients and our communities. 
Looking back on the last year and the past two decades — starting from my time 
as CEO of Bank One in 2000 — it is clear that our financial discipline, constant 
investment in innovation and ongoing development of our people are what  
enabled us to persevere in our steadfast dedication to help clients, communities 
and countries throughout the world. 2021 was another strong year for JPMorgan 
Chase, with the firm generating record revenue, as well as setting numerous 
other records in each of our lines of business. We earned $48.3 billion in net 
income on revenue of $125.3 billion versus $29.1 billion on revenue of $122.9  
billion in 2020, reflecting strong underlying performance across our businesses. 
Included in the $48.3 billion is $9.2 billion after tax in reserve releases due to 
the volatility introduced by the new current expected credit loss accounting 
3
standard. We have pointed out repeatedly that we do not consider these reserve 
releases core or recurring profits because they are driven by hypothetical,  
probability-weighted scenarios. Excluding these reserve releases, we still earned 
18% on tangible equity — an extremely healthy number. We generally grew mar-
ket share across our businesses and continued to make significant investments  
in products, people and technology, all while maintaining credit discipline and  
a fortress balance sheet. In total, we extended credit and raised capital of  
$3.2 trillion for large and small businesses, governments and U.S. consumers.
I’d like to note some steadfast principles that are worth repeating. The first is 
that while JPMorgan Chase stock is owned by large institutions, pension plans, 
mutual funds and directly by individual investors, in almost all cases, the 
ultimate beneficiaries are individuals in our communities. More than 100  
million people in the United States own stock, and a large percentage of these 
individuals, in one way or another, own JPMorgan Chase stock. Many of these 
people are veterans, teachers, police officers, firefighters, healthcare workers, 
retirees or those saving for a home, education or retirement. Your management 
team goes to work every day recognizing the enormous responsibility that we 
have to our shareholders. 
Second, while we don’t run the company worrying about the stock price in the 
short run, in the long run our stock price is a measure of the progress we have 
made over the years. This progress is a function of continual investments in  
our people, systems and products, in good and bad times, to build our capabili-
ties. Whether looking back 10 years or since the JPMorgan Chase/Bank One 
merger in 2004, these investments have resulted in our stock’s significant out-
performance of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and the Standard & Poor’s 
Financials Index. These important investments will also drive our company’s 
future prospects and position it to grow and prosper for decades.

1 On March 27, 2000, Jamie Dimon was hired as CEO of Bank One.
We have consistently described to you, our shareholders, the basic principles 
and strategies we use to build this company — from maintaining a fortress bal-
ance sheet, constantly investing and nurturing talent to fully satisfying regula-
tors, continually improving risk, governance and controls, and serving customers 
and clients while lifting up communities worldwide. 
If you look deeper, you will find that our success and accomplishments are founded 
on our commitment to our shareholders. Shareholder value can be built only if you 
maintain a healthy and vibrant company, which means doing a good job taking care 
of your customers, employees and communities. Conversely, how can you have a 
healthy company if you neglect any of these stakeholders? As we have learned in 
2021, there are myriad ways an institution can demonstrate its compassion for its 
employees and its communities while still upholding shareholder value.
Adhering to our basic principles and strategies allows us to drive good organic 
growth and properly manage our capital (including dividends and stock buy-
backs), as we have consistently demonstrated over the past decades. All of this 
is shown in the charts on pages 8-12, which illustrate how we have grown our 
6
franchises, how we compare with our competitors and how we look at our  
fortress balance sheet. I invite you to peruse them at your leisure. In addition,  
I urge you to read the CEO letters in this Annual Report, which will give you 
more specific details about our businesses and our plans for the future. 
There are two other critical points I would like to make. We strive to build endur-
ing businesses, and we are not a conglomerate — all our businesses rely on and 
benefit from each other. Both of these factors help generate our superior 
returns. But, despite our best efforts, the moats that protect this company are 
not particularly deep — and we face extraordinary competition. I have written 
about this reality extensively in the past and cover it in more detail in this letter. 
However, it is the hand we have been dealt, and we will play it as best we can.
My friend, Warren Buffett, spoke in his letter this year about his silent partner — 
the U.S. government — noting that all his company’s success is predicated upon 
the extraordinary conditions our country creates. He is right to say to his share-
holders that when they see the flag, they should all say thank you. We should, 
too. I do just want to note that in our case, the silent partner is not so silent. 
JPMorgan Chase is a healthy and thriving company, and we always want to give 
back and pay our fair share. We do — and we want it to be spent well and have 
the greatest impact. To give you an idea of where our taxes and fees go: In the 
last 10 years, we paid $42 billion in federal, state and local taxes in the United 
States and $17 billion in taxes outside of the United States. We also paid the  
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation $11 billion so that it has the resources  
to cover the failure of any major American bank.
Finally, the basis of our success is our people. They are the ones who serve our 
customers and communities, build the technology, make the strategic decisions, 
manage the risks, determine our investments and drive innovation. Whatever 
your view is of the world’s complexity and the risks and opportunities ahead, 
having a great team of people — with guts, brains, integrity and enormous capa-
bilities to navigate personally challenging circumstances while maintaining high 
standards of professional excellence — is what ensures our prosperity, now and 
in the future.

1 Excluding CIB Markets net interest income.
These assets are cash (essentially deposits at  
the Fed) and other highly marketable securities. 
This is an extraordinary amount of liquidity —
approximately $700 billion is required by the 
liquidity coverage ratio and will always consist  
of the most conservative assets.
These are still our riskiest assets,  
but you can see how small they are 
relative to the size of our balance 
sheet.
This is an extraordinary 
amount of consumer  
and wholesale deposits.
The best way to ascertain actual  
risk is by looking at Advanced risk-
weighted assets (RWA), which  
total only $1.1 trillion (excluding 
operational risk RWA) because so 
many assets have so little risk.
A large portion of our $125 billion  
of revenue is fairly recurring and  
predictable; for example, revenue 
from loans, Asset Management,  
Consumer Banking, Wealth  
Management, Securities Services  
and Payments. We’ve already told 
our shareholders that net interest 
income (excluding CIB Markets) will 
be more than $8 billion higher in 
2022, primarily due to higher rates.
We tend to look at this number  
on a more normalized basis. For 
example, charge-offs are artificially 
low in this part of the cycle (a more 
normal amount would be $7 billion 
versus $3 billion), and we don’t  
consider the reserve release of  
$12 billion as core or recurring profits. 
If you adjust for this and add back  
the $8 billion of normalized higher 
net interest income1, our normalized  
pre-tax profit would be closer to  
$50+ billion.
Our fortress balance sheet is accompanied by a fortress  
income statement. Even under extreme stress, our company 
could make a profit. For example, if credit losses were  
$10 billion higher or more, if we had a $10 billion operational 
error or if certain asset-based revenue dropped by as much  
as $10 billion, we would still be in very good shape.
And in terms of capital preservation, we could, if we had  
to, cut the dividend to zero, saving $12 billion in a year.  
Or we could reduce expenses substantially — which we could 
easily achieve.
There is more than $500 billion in 
preferred stock, long-term debt and 
common equity, an extraordinary 
capital base. Equally important, the 
amount of unsecured short-term 
financing, the riskiest type, is 
negligible.

Within this letter, I discuss the following: 
  SIGNIFICANT GEOPOLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CHALLENGES 
• The U.S. economy is strong.
• Persistent inflation will require rising interest rates and a massive but necessary 
shift from quantitative easing to quantitative tightening.
• The war in Ukraine and the sanctions on Russia, at a minimum, will slow the global 
economy — and it could easily get worse.
• The confluence of these factors may be unprecedented.
• The war could affect geopolitics for decades.
• How are we managing our global bank in these difficult markets and complex times? 
 
THE EXTRAORDINARY NEED FOR STRONG AMERICAN LEADERSHIP 
• While America has flaws, its essential strengths endure.
• To maintain our competitiveness, our country must regain its competence — and our 
principles, including free enterprise, need to be nurtured.
• Government, with its unique powers, has an essential role in managing the economy 
— but it needs to be realistic about its limitations on what it can and cannot do.
• We must confront the Russia challenge with bold solutions.
• A strong America need not fear a rising China.
• There are compelling reasons for global trade restructuring.
• We can have a path forward for U.S. policy: Agree on what we want, then execute. 
 
COMPETITIVE THREAT REDUX
• Banks performed magnificently during the COVID-19 crisis.
• The role of banks in the global financial system is diminishing.
• Possibly more important: The role of public companies in the global financial 
system is also diminishing. 
• More regulation is coming — 10 years after the crisis, we are still rolling out Basel IV 
— and we need more thoughtful calibration of the rules. 
• How should we address our G-SIB conundrum?
• Banks need to acknowledge the dramatically changing competitive landscape.

INVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS: DETERMINING THE BEST USE OF CAPITAL  
AND ASSESSING ROIs
• Some investments generate predictable returns.
• Acquisitions should pay for themselves — and each one has its own logic.
• We want to build upon our global footprint.
• We make extensive investments in technology for a broad range of reasons, from 
improving operations and security to enhancing our products and services. 
 
UPDATES ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY
• We are vigilant against cyber attacks.
• Our commitment to sustainability is informed by energy realities.
• Progress continues in our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.
• Morgan Health is helping us lead in healthcare transformation.
• We continue to support data-driven policymaking through the JPMorgan Chase 
PolicyCenter and Institute.
• We join other companies in evolving our vision of the workplace.  
 
MANAGEMENT LESSON: THE BENEFIT OF PURPOSE AND THE TREMENDOUS  
VALUE OF WORK
• Perfect your Picasso — have something to strive for and motivate you.
• Recognize the tremendous value of work.
• Nurture the extraordinary value of trust.
• Combat the enemy within.
• Drive high performance, the right way.
• Retaining talent is important and so is life outside of work.

Significant Geopolitical and 
Economic Challenges
ants and the global supply chain shortages, which 
were largely fueled by the dramatic upswing in 
consumer spending and the shift in that spend 
from services to goods. Fortunately, during these 
two years, vaccines for COVID-19 were also rap-
idly developed and distributed.
In today’s economy, the consumer is in excellent 
financial shape (on average), with leverage 
among the lowest on record, excellent mortgage 
underwriting (even though we’ve had home price 
appreciation), plentiful jobs with wage increases 
and more than $2 trillion in excess savings, 
mostly due to government stimulus. Most con-
sumers and companies (and states) are still flush 
with the money generated in 2020 and 2021, with 
consumer spending over the last several months 
12% above pre-COVID-19 levels. (But we must rec-
ognize that the account balances in lower-income 
households, smaller to begin with, are going 
down faster and that income for those house-
holds is not keeping pace with rising inflation.) 
Today’s economic landscape is completely differ-
ent from the 2008 financial crisis when the con-
sumer was extraordinarily overleveraged, as was 
the financial system as a whole — from banks and 
investment banks to shadow banks, hedge funds, 
private equity, Fannie Mae and many other enti-
ties. In addition, home price appreciation, fed by 
bad underwriting and leverage in the mortgage 
system, led to excessive speculation, which was 
missed by virtually everyone — eventually leading 
to nearly $1 trillion in actual losses. 
During 2020 and 2021, many aberrant things also 
happened: 2 million people retired early; the sup-
ply of immigrant workers dropped by 1 million 
due to immigration policies; available jobs sky-
rocketed to 11 million (again unprecedented); and 
job seekers dropped to 5 million. Wage growth 
accelerated dramatically, particularly in low-
income jobs. We should not be unhappy that 
wages are going up — and that workers have 
America and the rest of the world are facing the 
confluence of three important and conflicting 
forces: 1) a strong U.S. economy, which, we hope, 
has COVID-19 in its rearview mirror; 2) high  
inflation, which means rising interest rates and, 
importantly, the reversal of quantitative easing 
(QE); and 3) the war in Ukraine and the accompa-
nying humanitarian crisis, with its impact on the 
global economy in the short term, as well as its 
significant impact on the geopolitics of the future. 
These factors will likely have a meaningful effect 
on the economy over the next few years and on 
geopolitics for the next several decades. 
I should remind the reader that we normally don’t 
worry about — or even try to predict — normal fluc-
tuations of the economy. In all times, we are pre-
pared for difficult markets and severe recessions, 
as well as for unpredictable events, not only so we 
will survive them but also so we can be there for 
our clients when they need us the most. However, 
sometimes there are powerful underlying struc-
tural trends that we must try to understand since 
their impact can be so large, with widespread 
impact on many parts of human existence. 
THE U.S. ECONOMY IS STRONG.
In 2020 and 2021, enormous QE — approximately 
$4.4 trillion, or 18%, of 2021 gross domestic 
product (GDP) — and enormous fiscal stimulus 
(which has been and always will be inflationary) 
— approximately $5 trillion, or 21%, of 2021 GDP 
— stabilized markets and allowed companies to 
raise enormous amounts of capital. In addition, 
this infusion of capital saved many small busi-
nesses and put more than $2.5 trillion in the 
hands of consumers and almost $1 trillion into 
state and local coffers. These actions led to a 
rapid decline in unemployment, dropping from 
15% to under 4% in 20 months — the magnitude 
and speed of which were both unprecedented. 
Additionally, the economy grew 7% in 2021 
despite the arrival of the Delta and Omicron vari-
15

more choices and are making different decisions 
— in spite of the fact that this causes some diffi-
culties for business. House prices surged during 
the pandemic (housing became and still is in 
extremely short supply), and asset prices 
remained high, some, in my view, in bubble terri-
tory. Inflation soared to 7%; while clearly some of 
this rise is transitory due to supply chain short-
ages, some is not, because higher wages, higher 
housing costs, and higher energy and commodity 
prices will persist (more to come on this later).  
All these factors will continue in 2022, driving 
further growth as well as continued inflation. One 
additional point: Consumer confidence and con-
sumer spending have diverged dramatically, with 
consumer confidence dropping. Spending, how-
ever, is more important, and the drop in con-
sumer confidence may be in reaction to ongoing 
fatigue from the pandemic shutdown and con-
cerns over high inflation. 
PERSISTENT INFLATION WILL REQUIRE 
RISING INTEREST RATES AND A MASSIVE 
BUT NECESSARY SHIFT FROM 
QUANTITATIVE EASING TO QUANTITATIVE 
TIGHTENING.
It is easy to second-guess complex decisions after 
the fact. The Federal Reserve (the Fed) and the 
government did the right thing by taking bold 
dramatic actions following the misfortune 
unleashed by the pandemic. In hindsight, it 
worked. But also in hindsight, the medicine (fiscal 
spending and QE) was probably too much and 
lasted too long. 
I do not envy the Fed for what it must do next: 
The stronger the recovery, the higher the rates 
that follow (I believe that this could be signifi-
cantly higher than the markets expect) and the 
stronger the quantitative tightening (QT). If the 
Fed gets it just right, we can have years of 
growth, and inflation will eventually start to 
recede. In any event, this process will cause lots 
of consternation and very volatile markets. The 
Fed should not worry about volatile markets 
unless they affect the actual economy. A strong 
economy trumps market volatility. 
This is in no way traditional Fed tightening — and 
there are no models that can even remotely give 
us the answers. I have always been critical of 
people’s excessive reliance on models — since 
they don’t capture major catalysts, such as cul-
ture, character and technological advances. And 
in our current situation, the Fed needs to deal 
with things it has never dealt with before (and 
are impossible to model), including supply chain 
issues, sanctions, war and a reversal of QE in the 
face of unparalleled inflation. Obviously, the Fed 
always needs to be data-dependent, and this is 
true today more than ever before. However, the 
data will likely continue to be inconsistent and 
volatile — and hard to read. The Fed should strive 
for consistency but not when it’s impossible  
to achieve. 
One thing the Fed should do, and seems to have 
done, is to exempt themselves — give themselves 
ultimate flexibility — from the pattern of raising 
rates by only 25 basis points and doing so on a 
regular schedule. And while they may announce 
how they intend to reduce the Fed balance sheet, 
they should be free to change this plan on a 
moment’s notice in order to deal with actual 
events in the economy and the markets. A Fed 
that reacts strongly to data and events in real 
time will ultimately create more confidence. In 
any case, rates will need to go up substantially. 
The Fed has a hard job to do so let’s all wish them 
the best.
The shift from QE to QT will cause a massive 
change in the flow of funds in and out of Treasury 
bonds and, therefore, all securities. Our situation 
today is completely unlike the monetary policy 
adjustments following the great financial crisis of 
2008. When central banks were buying bonds 
from 2008 to 2014, there was a tremendous 
amount of deleveraging in the rest of the finan-
cial world. Clearly, this deleveraging slowed 
growth, which in turn reduced the need for busi-
ness investment. In addition, banks were required 
to buy Treasuries to meet their new liquidity 
requirements. This action reduced both lending 
and the money supply in the years after the great 
financial crisis. Low growth also led to less capital 
needed, and QE added to the savings glut. I am 
16
SIGNIFICANT GEOPOLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CHALLENGES
As I write this letter, the war in Ukraine has been 
raging for well over a month and is creating a sig-
nificant refugee crisis. We do not know what its 
outcome ultimately will be, but the hostilities in 
Ukraine and the sanctions on Russia are already 
having a substantial economic impact. They have 
roiled global oil, commodity and agricultural mar-
kets. We expect the fallout from the war and 
resulting sanctions to reduce Russia’s GDP by 
12.5% by midyear (a decline worse than the 10% 
drop after the 1998 default). Our economists cur-
rently think that the euro area, highly dependent 
on Russia for oil and gas, will see GDP growth of 
roughly 2% in 2022, instead of the elevated 4.5% 
pace we had expected just six weeks ago. By con-
trast, they expect the U.S. economy to advance 
roughly 2.5% versus a previously estimated 3%. 
But I caution that these estimates are based upon 
a fairly static view of the war in Ukraine and the 
sanctions now in place. 
Many more sanctions could be added — which 
could dramatically, and unpredictably, increase 
their effect. Along with the unpredictability of 
war itself and the uncertainty surrounding global 
commodity supply chains, this makes for a poten-
tially explosive situation. I speak later about the 
precarious nature of the global energy supply, 
but for now, simply, that supply is easy to disrupt. 
(We should also keep in mind that, as a percent-
age of global GDP, oil is only about 40% of what it 
was in 1973 — but it is still essential and critical.)
THE CONFLUENCE OF THESE FACTORS 
MAY BE UNPRECEDENTED. 
Each of these three factors mentioned above is 
unique in its own right: The dramatic stimulus-
fueled recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic,  
the likely need for rapidly raising rates and the 
required reversal of QE, and the war in Ukraine 
and the sanctions on Russia. They present com-
pletely different circumstances than what we’ve 
experienced in the past — and their confluence 
may dramatically increase the risks ahead. 
still convinced that these are some of the primary 
reasons our economy experienced low growth 
and so-called “secular stagnation.”
In today’s economic environment, countries’ cen-
tral banks do not need to increase their foreign 
exchange reserves as they did after the great 
financial crisis, and banks don’t need to buy Trea-
suries to improve their liquidity ratios. This time 
around, business investment will likely be higher, 
both because of higher growth and because the 
capital required to combat climate change is esti-
mated to be more than $4 trillion annually. 
Finally, governments will also need to borrow 
more money — not less. 
This massive change in the flow of funds trig-
gered by Fed tightening is certain to have market 
and economic effects that will be studied for 
decades to come. Our bank is prepared for drasti-
cally higher rates and more volatile markets. 
THE WAR IN UKRAINE AND THE 
SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA, AT A MINIMUM, 
WILL SLOW THE GLOBAL ECONOMY — AND 
IT COULD EASILY GET WORSE.
The effects of geopolitics on the economy are 
harder to predict. For as much attention as it 
gets, geopolitics over the past 50 years have 
rarely disrupted the global economy in the short 
run (think Afghanistan; Iraq; Korea; Vietnam; con-
flicts between Pakistan and India, India and 
China, China and Vietnam, Russia and China; and 
at least 10 other upheavals and wars in the Mid-
dle East). The 1973 Organization of the Petroleum 
Exporting Countries, or OPEC, oil embargo was an 
exception, when the sharp jump in oil prices 
pushed the world into a global recession. How-
ever, it’s important to point out that while past 
geopolitical events often did not have short-term 
economic effects, they frequently had large,  
longer-term consequences — such as America’s 
experience with the Vietnam War, which drove 
the great inflation of the 1970s and 1980s and 
tore the body politic apart. 
17
SIGNIFICANT GEOPOLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CHALLENGES
While it is possible, and hopeful, that all of these 
events will have peaceful resolutions, we should 
prepare for the potential negative outcomes.  
In the next section, I discuss immediate actions 
we should take to protect us from potential seri-
ous problems. 
THE WAR COULD AFFECT GEOPOLITICS 
FOR DECADES.
Russian aggression is having another dramatic 
and important result: It is coalescing the demo-
cratic, Western world — across Europe and the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) coun-
tries to Australia, Japan and Korea. The United 
States and the West realize there is no replace-
ment for strong allies and strong militaries. 
The war and prior trade disputes with China also 
highlight the critical importance of economic 
relationships and trade, particularly trade that 
involves anything affecting national security. The 
outcome of these two issues will transcend Russia 
and likely will affect geopolitics for decades, 
potentially leading to both a realignment of alli-
ances and a restructuring of global trade. How 
the West comports itself, and whether the West 
can maintain its unity, will likely determine the 
future global order and shape America’s (and its 
allies’) important relationship with China, which  
I talk more about later in this letter. 
HOW ARE WE MANAGING OUR GLOBAL 
BANK IN THESE DIFFICULT MARKETS AND 
COMPLEX TIMES?
Our hearts go out to all of those affected by the 
war — JPMorgan Chase and its employees have 
already donated over $5 million to the Ukrainian 
humanitarian crisis, with more to come. 
JPMorgan Chase has also played its part in the 
implementation of the Western world’s policies 
and sanctions regarding Russia. Of course, we are 
following both the letter of the law and the spirit 
of all the American and allied sanctions, working 
hand in hand with governments to implement 
complex policies and directives, and then some. 
Managing this has been an enormous undertak-
ing. It is completely different from navigating a 
financial crisis or a severe recession. This entails 
sanctioning individuals, including their ownership 
of assets and companies; reducing exposures 
across multiple products and services; analyzing 
and stopping billions of dollars of payments as 
directed by governments; and many other actions. 
We are not worried about our direct exposure to 
Russia, though we could still lose about $1 billion 
over time. But we are actively monitoring the 
impact of ongoing sanctions and Russia’s 
response, concerned as well about their second-
ary and collateral effects on so many companies 
and countries. We have been steadfast in our 
operating principles to be prepared for the 
unpredictable. Rest assured that our manage-
ment teams, hundreds of us, globally, have been 
working around the clock to do the right thing.

SIGNIFICANT GEOPOLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CHALLENGES
The Extraordinary Need for 
Strong American Leadership 
Even before the war in Ukraine jeopardized the 
world order, we were facing exceptional and 
enormous global challenges — nuclear prolifera-
tion (this is still the biggest risk to mankind, bar 
none, and made all the more stark by the war  
in Ukraine), threats to cybersecurity, terrorism, 
climate change, pressures on free and fair trade, 
and vast inequities in society. Critical to solving 
these problems is strong American leadership. 
American global leadership is the best course for 
the world and for America — and our leadership 
needs to articulate to its citizens why this is the 
case. The war in Ukraine reminds us that in a 
troubled world, national security always 
becomes the paramount concern. We should 
never again forget that this is true even in peace-
ful times — and we should never again be lulled 
into a false sense of security. Power abhors a 
vacuum, and it should be increasingly clear to all 
that without strong American leadership, chaos 
likely will prevail.
The world does not want an arrogant America tell-
ing everyone what to do but, instead, wants Amer-
ica working with allies, collaborating and compro-
mising. Most of the world would applaud mature, 
respectful and civil leadership by America. We can 
organize military and economic frameworks that 
make the world safe and prosperous for democ-
racy and freedom only if we work with our allies. 
If Western allies across Europe and Asia realize 
there is power in strong partnership, it puts the 
Western world in a better position to address 
future challenges, including those posed by  
China’s growth. This is applicable to areas where 
we have common interests (e.g., anti-terrorism, 
nuclear proliferation, climate change), as well as 
to areas where we may not (e.g., economic and 
political competition). 
It also is clear that trade and supply chains, where 
they affect matters of national security, need to 
be restructured. You simply cannot rely on coun-
tries with different strategic interests for critical 
goods and services. Such reorganization does not 
need to be a disaster or decoupling. With thought-
ful analysis and execution, it should be rational 
and orderly. This is in everyone’s best interest. 
WHILE AMERICA HAS FLAWS, ITS 
ESSENTIAL STRENGTHS ENDURE.
Many feel despondent about the “decline” of 
America. Our economy has had anemic growth 
for decades. COVID-19 and George Floyd’s murder 
cast a spotlight on what we already knew — that 
our lower-income citizens, often minorities, suffer 
more in our society, particularly during reces-
sions and times of turmoil. Continuing income 
inequality may very well be causing growing par-
tisanship, as some people believe the American 
dream is fraying and that our system is unfair, 
leaving many of our citizens behind. 
In prior letters, I have detailed our poor manage-
ment of basic policy in America and what the  
consequences have been from that dysfunction: 
ineffective education systems, soaring healthcare 
costs, excessive regulation and bureaucracy, the 
inability to plan and build infrastructure effi-
ciently, inequitable taxes, a capricious and waste-
ful litigation system, frustrating immigration poli-
cies and reform, inefficient mortgage markets and 
housing policy, a partially untrained and unpre-
pared labor force, excessive student debt, and the 
lack of proper federal government budgeting and 
spending, which lead to huge inefficiencies. Since  
I have covered these issues at length in the past,  
I will not elaborate on them here. I do, however, 
want to point out (and I find it disheartening) how 
readily we accept the failure, often with a chuckle, 
of our bureaucracy and policies.
Our country is not perfect, but our basic princi-
ples — i.e., the rule of law, individual liberties, 
freedom of speech and religion, and the concept 
of equal opportunity — are still exceptional ideals 
that most of the world wants yet often is not able 
to achieve. These principles still make America 
19
THE EXTRAORDINARY NEED FOR STRONG AMERICAN LEADERSHIP
the partner of choice for many countries and the 
destination of choice for many individuals. Our 
American system gave us one of the world’s most 
prosperous and innovative economies. I do not 
like it when anyone disparages this wonderful 
country because of our flaws. Though our sins 
may be real, they are the sins of all countries.  
We can celebrate this country for having given so 
much to so many while acknowledging prior mis-
takes and fixing them. It is shocking to me how 
many people denigrate not just America but free 
enterprise and the essential role of business. If 
America could open its borders to all, I have little 
doubt that billions of people, if they could, would 
want to come here, and few would leave. 
America has faced tough times before — the Civil 
War, World War I, the U.S. stock market crash of 
1929 and the Great Depression that followed, 
World War II and 9/11, among others. As recently 
as the late 1960s and 1970s, we struggled with 
the loss of the Vietnam War, political and racial 
injustice, recessions and inflation. (Do you 
remember America’s obsession and fear about 
the emergence of Japan as an economic power in 
the 1980s?) In each case, however, America’s 
resiliency persevered and ultimately strength-
ened our position in the world. We hope this time 
is no different, but we should not be complacent 
as we do not have a divine right to success.
TO MAINTAIN OUR COMPETITIVENESS, 
OUR COUNTRY MUST REGAIN ITS 
COMPETENCE — AND OUR PRINCIPLES, 
INCLUDING FREE ENTERPRISE, NEED TO 
BE NURTURED.
America’s moral, economic and military might all 
derive from our principles and are also predi-
cated on the strength and competence of the 
American system. We must acknowledge that 
nurturing and maintaining our enormously pros-
perous economy provides the foundation of that 
system. Ultimately, that economy is what pays for 
the best military the world has ever seen.
Over the past 20 years, our economy has grown, 
on average, at only 2%. American ingenuity, 
work ethic, technology and business capability 
were able to overcome some — but not all — of 
our mismanagement. We should not accept 
mediocrity; we no longer imagine what should 
be: Over the past decade, we should have grown 
at 3.5%.
Freedom and its brother, free enterprise,  
properly regulated are the answer — not  
unconstrained capitalism nor crony capitalism, 
where business uses government and regula-
tions to maintain its position or strengthen its 
hand. All interest groups, business groups 
included, should applaud good public policy  
and not resist it for self-serving reasons.
Free enterprise celebrates, and is inseparable 
from, human freedom and creativity, which ulti-
mately are the sources of all human progress. The 
secret sauce of free enterprise is not only the free 
movement of capital but also, more importantly, 
the value of knowledge and free people exercising 
their rights.
Nonetheless, many countries — inadvertently 
through decades of following bad policy or delib-
erately by restricting freedoms — damage the full 
benefit of free enterprise and often discourage 
savings, innovation, and the free movement of 
people and labor. We all believe in great social 
safety nets that reduce poverty, provide opportu-
nity for good jobs and serve as an engine for  
economic growth. But freedom slowly disappears 
when a country’s government controls too much 
of its economy, and people in nearly every coun-
try, free or not, do not like constantly being told 
what to do. It is disingenuous when political lead-
ers say that government “built the roads” and 
then use that statement as an argument to sup-
press free enterprise. The roads were built by the 
people and for the people so that all could travel 
and prosper.
What we really need are free enterprise, more 
civic-minded companies and citizens, and extraor-
dinarily competent government and policies.
20
THE EXTRAORDINARY NEED FOR STRONG AMERICAN LEADERSHIP
GOVERNMENT, WITH ITS UNIQUE 
POWERS, HAS AN ESSENTIAL ROLE IN 
MANAGING THE ECONOMY — BUT IT 
NEEDS TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT ITS 
LIMITATIONS ON WHAT IT CAN AND 
CANNOT DO.
We have fallen into the rut of false narratives, 
which distracts us from facing reality. We don’t 
define our problems properly. If you have the 
wrong diagnosis of a problem, you will certainly 
have the wrong solution. Even if you have the 
right diagnosis, you still may arrive at the wrong 
solution — but your odds are certainly much  
better. Our policies are often incomprehensible 
and uncoordinated, and our policy decisions  
frequently have no forethought and no identifica-
tion of desired outcomes. 
We sometimes blame inflation on corporate prof-
its — for example, the cost of meat in the United 
States is high not because of the profits earned by 
the meat packing industry but because of high 
cattle and feed costs and disruptions in logistics. 
Similarly, energy costs are high not because of 
price gouging but because of the dramatic decline 
in investments in energy, which results in reduced 
supply when demand goes up. Regulation has dra-
matically impeded our ability to build good infra-
structure in a timely manner — the cost of building 
a highway has more than tripled in 20 years 
purely because of expenses due to regulations.
Our politics are dysfunctional, which has prevented 
some of our best, brightest and most competent 
to want to work in government. While we have 
plenty of economists, academics and lifetime pol-
iticians in government, who I know are committed 
to doing their best, we need additional brain-
power, capabilities and experience from leaders 
across all sectors of our society, including busi-
ness. It is going to take extraordinary, broad-
based leadership to solve our problems.
There are some things only the federal govern-
ment can do — among them, protect national 
security, operate federal courts, act as a central 
bank, perform certain research and development 
(R&D), and execute some national infrastructure. 
While government cannot create jobs outside of 
government itself, it can optimize the conditions 
under which jobs can be created. If it simply 
exhibits consistency and competence in the per-
formance of its tasks, government will maximize 
investments and jobs. Conversely, government 
can destroy jobs and capital investment through 
bureaucracy, red tape and constant policy 
changes. Government cannot and will not be able 
to hold back technology, but it can foster an envi-
ronment that promotes quick retraining of those 
who are replaced by technological advancements. 
Our problems are neither Democratic nor 
Republican — nor are the solutions. Unfortunately, 
however, partisan politics are preventing  
collaborative policy from being designed and 
implemented, particularly at the federal level.  
We would do better if we listened to one another. 
Democrats should acknowledge Republicans’ 
legitimate concerns that money sent to Washing-
ton often ends up in large wasteful programs, 
ultimately offering little value to local communi-
ties. Democrats could acknowledge that while we 
need good government, it is not the answer to 
everything. Democrats could also acknowledge 
that a healthy fear of a large central government 
is not irrational (like a leviathan).
Republicans need to acknowledge that America 
can and should afford to provide a proper safety 
net for our elderly, our sick and our poor, as well 
as help create an environment that generates 
more opportunities and more income for more 
Americans. Republicans could acknowledge that if 
the government can demonstrate that it is spend-
ing money wisely, we should spend more — think 
infrastructure and education funding. And that 
may very well mean higher taxes for the wealthy. 
Should that happen, the wealthy should keep in 
mind that if tax monies improve our society and 
our economy, then those same individuals will be, 
in effect, among the main beneficiaries.
Democrats and Republicans often seem to be 
ships passing in the night — with both parties 
talking at cross purposes even when they may 
share the same goals. Compromise is not incom-
patible with democracy — in fact, compromise is  
21
THE EXTRAORDINARY NEED FOR STRONG AMERICAN LEADERSHIP
a core principle of democracy. Enacting major 
policies on a purely partisan basis (think health-
care and tax reform) virtually guarantees 
decades of fighting. It’s not unreasonable to 
assert that major policies should be bipartisan  
or not at all. 
We must remember that the concepts of free 
enterprise, rugged individualism and entrepre-
neurship are not incompatible with meaningful 
safety nets and the desire to lift up our disadvan-
taged citizens. We can acknowledge the excep-
tional history of America and also acknowledge 
our flaws, which need redress.
WE MUST CONFRONT THE RUSSIA 
CHALLENGE WITH BOLD SOLUTIONS.
America must be ready for the possibility of an 
extended war in Ukraine with unpredictable out-
comes. We should prepare for the worst and hope 
for the best. We must look at this as a wake-up 
call. We need to pursue short-term and long-term 
strategies with the goal of not only solving the 
current crisis but also maintaining the long-term 
unity of the newly strengthened democratic alli-
ances. We need to make this a permanent, long-
lasting stand for democratic ideals and against 
all forms of evil. 
Our nation’s solutions need to be bold, brave  
and dynamic — and they have to be bipartisan — 
because we know only bipartisan solutions stand 
on firm ground. Bipartisanship could start with 
the appointment of Republicans to the cabinet. 
We need to think broadly because whatever we do 
will not only help determine the fate of the war in 
Ukraine but likely will determine the ability of the 
Western democratic world to address critical 
future challenges. We also need to ensure that 
the Western coalition remains economically com-
petitive on the world stage. The better America 
performs as a country in dealing with Russia now, 
the easier it will be for us to engage with the rest 
of the world, including China, going forward.
In addition to being big, clear-eyed and realistic, 
our solutions should acknowledge that we are 
essentially, and unfortunately, reverting to some 
Cold War strategies. Here are some actions we 
should take immediately:
• Demonstrate leadership and commitment to 
 a long-term military strategy by meaningfully 
increasing our military budget and troop 
deployment on NATO’s borders, as appropriate. 
To both sides, these steps make our resolve 
clear and reflect our recognition of the grave 
new geopolitical realities.
• Direct billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine, 
announced now, to support the country  
currently and to help rebuild in the future.  
We should also help the Europeans with the 
enormous migration issues they are facing.  
The United States could take the lead in 
humanitarian efforts and ask all nations, 
including China, to join us in this response.
• Turn up sanctions — there are many more that 
could be imposed — in whatever way national 
security experts recommend to maximize the 
right outcomes.
• We need a “Marshall Plan” to ensure energy 
security for us and our European allies. Our 
European allies, who are highly dependent on 
Russian energy, require our help. For such a 
plan to succeed, we need to secure proper 
energy supplies immediately for the next  
few years, which can be done while reducing 
CO2 emissions.
As we are seeing — and know from past  
experience — oil and gas supply can be easily 
disrupted, either physically or by additional 
sanctions, significantly impacting energy 
prices. National security demands energy  
security for ourselves and for our allies over-
seas. Fortunately, we do not need to change 
our long-term objectives on climate change 
and greenhouse gases, and we should remind 
ourselves that using gas to diminish coal con-
sumption is an actionable way to reduce CO2 
emissions expeditiously. While the United 
States is fairly energy independent, we need to 
increase our energy production and get more 
gas (in the form of liquefied natural gas) to 
Europe immediately. Our work with all of our 
allies should include urging them to both 
22
THE EXTRAORDINARY NEED FOR STRONG AMERICAN LEADERSHIP
increase their production and deliver some of  
it to Europe. To do this, we also need immedi-
ate approval for additional oil leases and  
gas pipelines, as well as permits for green 
energy projects; i.e., solar and wind. We  
cannot accomplish our goals with misguided 
and counterproductive policies. 
Strong, bold and comprehensive short-term and 
long-term policies, persistently and properly exe-
cuted, will maximize the strength and the durable 
unity of the democratic world. Not only will this 
be very good for the Western world in general, 
but it will help frame our approach with China. 
A STRONG AMERICA NEED NOT FEAR A 
RISING CHINA. 
The most important relationship over the next 
100 years will be the one between America (and 
its allies) and China. The stronger the allied 
nations, the better it is for America. But for 
America to get this essential relationship right, 
we need to have a clear-eyed view of our strategic 
economic and national security interests. 
America is not operating from a position of weak-
ness; indeed, our strengths are extraordinary. 
Conversely, over the next 40 years, China will have 
to grapple with some serious issues: For all of its 
strengths, China still needs more food, water and 
energy to support its population; pollution is ram-
pant; corruption continues to be a problem; state-
owned enterprises are often inefficient; corporate 
and government debt levels are growing rapidly; 
financial markets lack depth, transparency and 
adequate rule of law; income inequality remains 
highly prevalent; and its working age population 
has been declining since 2015. China will continue 
to face pressure from the United States and other 
Western governments over human rights, democ-
racy and freedom in Hong Kong, and activity in the 
South China Sea and Taiwan.
Asia is a very tangled continent, geopolitically 
speaking. Many of China’s neighbors (Afghani-
stan, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Pakistan, the 
Philippines, Russia and Vietnam) are large, com-
plicated and not always friendly to China — in 
fact, China has had border skirmishes and wars 
with India, the Soviet Union and Vietnam since 
World War II. These neighbors do not all look at 
the rise of China as being completely beneficial. 
By comparison, America is at peace with its North 
American neighbors and is protected by the 
Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
America and China have large differences: ideo-
logical, democracy versus single-party rule, and 
market capitalism versus state-controlled capital-
ism. We also have common interests: halting 
nuclear proliferation, reducing terrorism, stop-
ping climate change and promoting peaceful rela-
tionships. All countries, including China, want to 
lift up their people. Done right, we can establish 
and maintain a relationship with China that will 
allow both countries and the world to thrive.
Because we are dealing with a combination of cir-
cumstances that we have never confronted before 
— the rise of a country equal in size to us, unfair 
trade and bilateral investment rights, and state-
sponsored subsidies and competition — we will 
need to respond in equally unprecedented ways. 
We should stop complaining about unfair prac-
tices and just take appropriate action. Both coun-
tries can take unilateral actions as they see fit in 
the economic domain — and they already do — 
and that is okay. 
To counter unfair competition on China’s part 
(i.e., subsidies and state-sponsored monopolies), 
we will need to develop thoughtful policies and 
strategies that work. We also need to develop 
“industrial policies” that help industries impor-
tant to national security (for example, semicon-
ductors, 5G, rare earths and others) succeed. I 
believe this could be done intelligently and not as 
“handouts” or subsidies that create excessive 
profits. This will also require increased govern-
ment R&D focused on activities that business  
simply cannot do alone — advanced science,  
military technologies, among others. 
Although there will be global trade restructuring, 
lots of global trade (and trade with China) will 
remain even after trade partnerships have been 
altered. Keep in mind, China’s trade with the West 
and the United States in 2021 totaled $3.6 trillion 
23
THE EXTRAORDINARY NEED FOR STRONG AMERICAN LEADERSHIP
(exports and imports). By contrast, China’s total 
trade with Russia in 2021 totaled almost $150  
billion. Clearly, these economic relationships are 
critical to China and the West — China also has a 
huge interest in making this work.
All of these policies must be done in conjunction 
with our allies or they will not be effective — 
because without a united front, unfair economic 
and trade practices will still be allowed to flour-
ish. If it were up to me, I would rejoin the Trans-
Pacific Partnership (TPP). We need to look at 
trade as only one part of strategic economic part-
nerships — and that’s exactly what TPP did. There 
is a lot at stake, but there is no reason why seri-
ous, comprehensive, honest negotiations can’t 
lead to good outcomes.
THERE ARE COMPELLING REASONS FOR 
GLOBAL TRADE RESTRUCTURING.
There is no question that supply chains need to 
be restructured for three different reasons:
• For any products or materials that are essential 
for national security (think rare earths, 5G and 
semiconductors), the U.S. supply chain must 
either be domestic or open only to completely 
friendly allies. We cannot and should not ever 
be reliant on processes that can and will be 
used against us, especially when we are most 
vulnerable. 
• For similar national security reasons, activities 
(including investment activities) that help  
create a national security risk — i.e., sharing 
critical technology with potential adversaries — 
should be restricted.
• Companies will diversify their supply chains 
simply to be more resilient. 
This restructuring will likely take place over time 
and does not need to be extraordinarily disrup-
tive. There will be winners and losers — some of 
the main beneficiaries will be Brazil, Canada, 
Mexico and friendly Southeast Asian nations.
Along with reconfiguring our supply chains, we 
must create new trading systems with our allies. 
As mentioned above, my preference would be to 
rejoin the TPP — it is the best geostrategic and 
trade arrangement possible with allied nations.
WE CAN HAVE A PATH FORWARD FOR U.S. 
POLICY: AGREE ON WHAT WE WANT, THEN 
EXECUTE.
We need more real leaders — people who know 
how to get things done, who are capable and who 
can educate and explain to all citizens what we 
need and why. We need a renaissance of the 
American dream and American “can-do” 
exceptionalism. 
Our leaders need to agree on what we want and 
then execute to get it done. At a minimum, we 
should all agree that we want: 
• The world’s most prosperous economy, which 
would also mean having the world’s reserve 
currency. The strength and the importance of 
the U.S. dollar are predicated on the strength 
and openness of the U.S. economy, the rule of 
law and the free movement of capital.
• Regulations and policies that foster growth and 
accomplish stated goals but don’t cripple busi-
ness innovation and investment. Policies need to 
be consistent, reliable and constantly reviewed 
to reduce red tape and increase efficiency. 
• A new strategic economic and competitive 
framework, devised in partnership with our 
allies (particularly as it relates to China), which 
includes trade and industrial policy, as previ-
ously discussed. This does need rebranding. 
Trade is only part of an economic relationship 
(there are investment rights, property rights, 
education, immigration rights and so on). We 
should always negotiate strategic economic 
agreements remembering that whether you 
emerge with a formal agreement or not, you 
likely have created a policy. 
• A “Marshall Plan,” as previously mentioned, to 
ensure energy security for us and our Euro-
pean allies, requiring us to secure proper 
energy supplies immediately for the next few 
years (which can be done while reducing CO2 
emissions and combatting climate change). 
24
THE EXTRAORDINARY NEED FOR STRONG AMERICAN LEADERSHIP
Learning from Other Countries’ Successes – 
and Failures
It is always instructive to look around the world 
at policies and countries that work — and policies 
and countries that don’t work. For example, you 
can find countries that have done a great job pro-
viding safety nets — without damaging labor — 
and building infrastructure efficiently without 
crippling regulations. A number of countries have 
succeeded in developing themselves, surprisingly 
often with minimal natural resources: Ireland, 
Israel, Singapore, South Korea and Sweden.  
Singapore has developed effective healthcare 
programs. Germany and Switzerland have created 
impressive work apprenticeship models, and 
Hong Kong has excelled at infrastructure. 
Another inspiring example is Ireland. After 
decades of sectarian strife and terrorism, Ireland 
is now a melting pot with a thriving economy due 
to good government policies. 
Then there are the counterexamples, countries 
sometimes flush with natural resources — Argen-
tina, Cuba and Venezuela. Rarely is the successful 
nation the socialist or autocratic one. And all of 
the negative cases are either socialist govern-
ments or governments hypothetically run in the 
name of the people. The successful nations, on 
the other hand, all are market-based economies 
of slightly different types with policies that grow 
their economy and share the nation’s wealth. 
Sweden is a good example of a country that many 
consider socialist, but it is far from it. By most 
measures, Sweden is actually more of a market-
based economy than the United States, and it has 
enormous wealth and extremely strong social 
safety nets.
• The strongest military in the world — continu-
ally maintained, though used judiciously and 
in conjunction with our allies. The strength of 
the military needs to be matched by the 
strength of our diplomatic, development and 
intelligence agencies.
• A more equitable labor market that maximizes 
employment and values all jobs, effective and 
continuous job training for workers of all ages, 
and practices that better promote sharing the 
wealth — i.e., higher minimum wages, an 
increased Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), 
broader healthcare coverage and other related 
policies.
• A strong America that respects all its citizens, 
helps the poor and disadvantaged, honors 
again the dignity of work, and demonstrates 
character and civility. And we all want well-
functioning, healthy social safety nets. 
The war in Ukraine and the growing competitive-
ness of China — including its growing military and 
strategic alliances across the globe — dictate that 
we move forward on our comprehensive needs.  
If we do not resolve our problems and restore 
effective long-term leadership, it is easy to envi-
sion darker days ahead in both the economic and 
geopolitical realms. But with great leadership, 
America, our allies and the rest of the world will 
enjoy a brighter future.
25
THE EXTRAORDINARY NEED FOR STRONG AMERICAN LEADERSHIP
Competitive Threat Redux 
The growing competition to banks from each 
other, shadow banks, fintechs and large technol-
ogy companies is intensifying and clearly contrib-
uting to the diminishing role of banks and public 
companies in the United States and the global 
financial system. Before we give an update on the 
structural shifts taking place, it would be good to 
address the question: How did banks perform 
during the recent COVID-19 crisis? 
BANKS PERFORMED MAGNIFICENTLY 
DURING THE COVID-19 CRISIS.
Within days of realizing COVID-19 was a pandemic 
that would virtually close large parts of the 
world’s economies, the U.S. government moved 
with unprecedented speed. Fortunately, most 
banks were part of the solution — unlike during 
the Great Recession when many banks were not. 
And fortunately, unlike during the Great Reces-
sion, the U.S. economy was actually in good 
shape going into the COVID-19 recession.
Yes, of course, it is true that large government 
actions dramatically helped individuals, compa-
nies (including banks) and the economy overall. 
But it is also true that banks performed magnifi-
cently during the COVID-19 crisis. They extended 
a huge amount of credit, waived fees and post-
poned debt repayment, and were at the forefront 
of delivering Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) 
loans to small businesses. And they did it the 
right way, protecting government money by  
trying to make legitimate loans to borrowers in 
need. By contrast, nonbanks were involved in 
instances of illegitimate PPP loans and Economic 
Injury Disaster Loan assistance, as well as stimu-
lus money fraud, often at rates almost five times 
those of traditional banks. As for us: 
• JPMorgan Chase was the #1 PPP lender — over 
the life of the program, we funded more than 
400,000 loans totaling over $40 billion.
• Since March 13, 2020, we delayed payments 
due and refunded fees for more than 3.5  
million customer accounts — refunding more 
than $250 million for nearly 2 million consumer 
deposit and lending accounts and offering 
delayed payments and forbearance on more 
than 2 million mortgage, auto and credit  
card accounts, representing approximately  
$90 billion in loans. 
• In 2020, we raised capital and provided credit 
totaling $2.3 trillion for customers and busi-
nesses of all sizes, helping them meet payroll, 
avoid layoffs and fund operations during that 
first year of the pandemic crisis. 
• In 2020, we committed $250 million in global 
business and philanthropic initiatives, with  
particular focus on the people and communi-
ties most vulnerable and hardest hit by the 
pandemic.
• In addition, JPMorgan Chase launched several 
ambitious flagship programs, including our  
$30 billion commitment to help close the racial 
wealth gap and drive economic inclusion, which 
is described in more detail within this letter.
While the U.S. government’s actions were a ben-
efit to the whole economy, including the banking 
industry, banks were more than able to weather 
the terrible financial storm while setting aside 
extensive reserves for potential future loan 
losses. Importantly, during this time, the Fed con-
ducted two additional, severely adverse Compre-
hensive Capital Analysis and Review stress tests, 
which projected bank results under extreme 
unemployment, GDP loss, market disruption and 
a smaller government stimulus. The results 
showed that banks could withstand these 
extreme conditions while continuing to finance 
the economy.

I also have very little doubt that if the severely 
adverse scenario played out, JPMorgan Chase 
would perform far better than the stress test pro-
jections. One supporting data point: From March 
5, 2020 to March 20, 2020, when the stock mar-
ket fell 24% and the bond index spread gapped 
from 191 to 446 prior to major Fed intervention, 
our actual trading revenue was higher than nor-
mal as we actively made markets for our clients. 
By contrast, the hypothetical stress test had  
us losing a huge amount of money in market-
making, based on the way it is calculated. While  
I understand why regulators stress test this way 
— they are essentially trying to ensure that banks 
survive the worst-case scenario — the methodol-
ogy clearly does not result in an accurate forecast 
of how our company would perform under 
adverse circumstances. 
THE ROLE OF BANKS IN THE GLOBAL 
FINANCIAL SYSTEM IS DIMINISHING.
Banks have advantages and disadvantages. Some 
of the advantages, including economies of scale, 
profitability and brand, may only diminish slowly. 
Unfortunately, it also seems likely that some of 
the disadvantages, such as uneven or costly regu-
lation, may not diminish at all. Other disadvan-
tages, like legacy systems, will diminish over time. 
Regulations have consequences, both intended 
and unintended — but many regulations are 
crafted with little regard for their interplay with 
other policies and their cumulative effect. As a 
result, regulations often are disconnected from 
their likely outcomes. This is particularly true 
when trying to determine what products and ser-
vices will remain inside the regulatory system as 
opposed to those likely to move outside of it.
Keep in mind that markets, not regulators, set 
capital requirements. If regulators set capital 
standards that are too high for banks to hold 
loans, then the markets will drive those loans 
outside of the banking system. There are also 
non-capital regulatory standards that can force 
activities out of the regulatory system, such as 
excessive reporting and social requirements, 
among others. 
Banks around the world are already engaged in 
tough competition with each other. A quick review 
of the chart on page 27 shows the phenomenal 
size of nonbanks — from payments companies and 
fintechs to exchanges and Big Tech — that com-
pete with traditional banks, but outside of the 
banking regulatory system, in providing certain 
financial services. And those don’t include many 
others, such as Schwab, Fidelity or Vanguard — 
which also provide banking-type services. The 
data also doesn’t show that last year alone,  
$130 billion was invested in fintech, allowing  
them to speed things up — and at scale. 
The pace of change and the size of the competition 
are extraordinary, and activity is accelerating. 
Walmart, for good reason (over 200 million cus-
tomers visit their stores each week) can use new 
digital technologies to efficiently bring banking-
type services to their customers. Apple, already a 
strong presence in banking-type services with 
Apple Pay and the Apple Card, is actively extend-
ing services into other banking-type products, 
such as payment processing, credit risk assess-
ment, person-to-person payment systems, mer-
chant acquiring and buy-now-pay-later offers.  
The large tech companies, already 100% digital, 
have hundreds of millions of customers, enormous 
resources in data and proprietary systems — all of 
which give them an extraordinary competitive 
advantage.  
Properly regulated banks are meant to protect and 
enhance the financial system. They are transpar-
ent with regulators, and they strive mightily to 
protect the system from terrorism financing and 
tax evasion as they implement know your cus-
tomer (KYC) and anti-money laundering laws. They 
protect clients’ assets and clients’ money in move-
ment. They also help customers — from protecting 
their data and minimizing fraud and cyber risk to 
providing financial education — and must abide  
by social requirements, such as the Community 
Reinvestment Act, which requires banks to extend 
their services into lower-income communities. 
Regulators need to figure out what they really 
want to achieve.

COMPETITIVE THREAT REDUX
The chart on page 27 shows banks’ decreasing 
role in the global economy, but a few examples 
will put it in stark contrast.
• Banks’ size and market cap (U.S. global  
systemically important bank [G-SIB] market  
cap is $1.5 trillion) have dramatically dimin-
ished relative to their nonbank competitors. 
• U.S. banks’ broker-dealer inventories have 
barely kept pace with the large increase in total 
markets. Banks’ dramatic decline in market-
making ability relative to the size of the public 
markets is a factor in the periodic disruptions 
that occur in the public markets. 
• U.S. banks’ loans in an 11-year period have only 
grown 65% and now represent only 8% of total 
U.S. debt and equity markets, down from 11% 
in 2010.
• Conversely, U.S. banks’ liquid assets are up 
more than 300% to $8.6 trillion, most of which 
is needed to meet liquidity requirements.
• Banks’ share of mortgage originations has 
gone from 91% to 32%.
• Banks’ share of the leveraged loan market  
has decreased over the last 20 years from  
46% to 13%. 
• Neobanks, now with over 50 million accounts, 
bypass the Durbin Amendment and so earn 
higher revenue per debit swipe — and they 
don’t have to abide by certain other regulatory 
or social requirements. 
• Other companies providing banking-type  
services have hundreds of millions of accounts 
that hold consumer money, process payments, 
access bank accounts and extensively use  
customer data.
• A sizable and growing portion of equity trading 
has moved off transparent exchanges to non-
traditional trading firms, causing a loss of 
access to on-exchange liquidity for many  
market participants.
I can go on and on, but suffice it to say, we must 
be prepared for this trend to continue.
It seems unlikely to me that all the banks, shadow 
banks and fintech companies will thrive as they 
strive to take share from each other over the next 
decade. I would expect to see many mergers among 
America’s 4,000+ banks — they need to do this, in 
some cases, to create more economies of scale to 
be able to compete. Other companies will try differ-
ent strategies, including bank-fintech mergers or 
mergers just between fintechs. You should expect 
to see some winners and lots of casualties — it’s 
just not possible for everyone to perform well. 
POSSIBLY MORE IMPORTANT: THE ROLE 
OF PUBLIC COMPANIES IN THE GLOBAL 
FINANCIAL SYSTEM IS ALSO DIMINISHING.
In addition to banks’ shrinking global role, you 
can see that the number of public companies, 
which should have grown substantially over the 
past decade, is remarkably reduced. Instead, U.S. 
public companies peaked in 1996 at 7,300 and 
now total 4,800. Conversely, the number of pri-
vate U.S. companies backed by private equity 
companies has grown from 1,600 to 10,100 — a 
remarkable increase. 
This migration is worthy of serious study. The 
reasons are complex and may include public mar-
ket factors, such as onerous reporting require-
ments, higher litigation expenses, costly regula-
tions, cookie-cutter board governance, less com-
pensation flexibility, heightened public scrutiny 
and the relentless pressure of quarterly earnings. 
It’s incumbent upon us to figure out why so many 
companies and so much capital are being moved 
out of transparent public markets to less trans-
parent private markets — and whether this is in 
the country’s long-term interest. We do need to 
ask some questions: Do we want public compa-
nies? Are we okay with more and more of our 
capital markets being private and, therefore, less 
regulated? If I were a shareholder of a company, I 
would ask myself, do I really think that all the 
rules we impose on public companies actually 
make them better? Finally, we need to consider, is 
it a good thing that many investors won’t have 
the opportunity to invest in these companies if 
and when they are private? 
29
COMPETITIVE THREAT REDUX
There are good and bad reasons why capital is 
going private. For example, private companies 
can raise money more easily now than in the 
past. Private companies’ boards and manage-
ment teams can focus primarily on the business, 
and private investors can be more patient with 
capital — they are not necessarily worried about 
short-term results. 
We need to study this public market diminishment 
thoughtfully and deeply — particularly since more 
regulation is coming that will affect this trend. 
This is a good time to think through and create 
the outcomes we want — and not just let multiple, 
often well-meaning but uncoordinated legal, reg-
ulatory and policy decisions take us where we do 
not want to go. 
MORE REGULATION IS COMING — 10 
YEARS AFTER THE CRISIS, WE ARE STILL 
ROLLING OUT BASEL IV — AND WE NEED 
MORE THOUGHTFUL CALIBRATION OF THE 
RULES. 
Basel IV seems likely to increase capital require-
ments for banks on credit, loans, trading books 
and operational risk, some of which is unneces-
sary. These risks are real, but they need to be 
properly and rationally calculated. For example, 
operational risk is real; it exists in all enterprises 
and is usually handled in the ordinary course of 
business. If all large companies had to hold capi-
tal for operational risk, following the standard set 
for banks, trillions of dollars of additional capital 
would be permanently held in idle funds. The 
question for all capital requirements is: How 
much is enough?
If done properly, bank regulations could be recali-
brated, adding virtually no additional risk, to 
make it easier for banks to make loans, interme-
diate markets and finance the economy. When it 
comes to political debate about banking regula-
tions, there is little truth to the notion that regu-
lations have been “loosened” — at least in the 
context of large banks.
We should keep in mind the enormous unintended 
consequences that could result from any policy 
(e.g., regulations) not being properly thought 
through. Policy with no forethought — designed 
without a comprehensive plan or instigated out of 
anger or false morality — can have bad outcomes. 
A few examples will suffice:
• The U.S. government management of student 
lending has been a disaster. In the 11 years 
since they’ve taken over student lending, they 
have extended an additional $1 trillion in loans. 
Prior to the pandemic, $300 billion of these 
loans were either severely delinquent or not 
being paid. We are not against student lending, 
but the disciplined use of capital should be 
applied here, too. I generally agree with the 
position that for loans that should not have 
been made and where the borrower reaped no 
benefit, there should be some forgiveness. 
However, many loans were properly made and 
brought the benefit that was expected. Govern-
ment should reform its policies to stop making 
loans that should never be made. 
• Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac contributed to the 
crisis in the mortgage market. In the mad rush 
to improve home ownership levels, these gov-
ernment-guaranteed institutions played a 
major part (along with many others engaged in 
the mortgage markets), over decades, in loos-
ening mortgage underwriting standards. Ulti-
mately, this proved catastrophic, leading to 
nearly $1 trillion in mortgage losses. Con-
versely, since then, mortgage regulations’ 
excessive tightening is not only pushing the 
mortgage market into the unregulated financial 
system but also making mortgages less avail-
able to mostly lower-income Americans.

HOW SHOULD WE ADDRESS OUR G-SIB 
CONUNDRUM?
The U.S. implementation of G-SIB requirements 
does not enable a level playing field — plain and 
simple. Not only have American rules made the 
G-SIB designation worse for American banks (if 
JPMorgan Chase could operate on the same basis 
as large European banks, our Tier 1 capital 
requirements would be reduced by $30 billion), 
but the rules have not been adjusted as the 
framework allows. G-SIB capital requirements 
were supposed to be modified to account for the 
increasing size of the global economy and the 
smaller size of banks in relation to that global 
economy — this simply has not happened. So  
JPMorgan Chase will be required to hold 2% more 
common equity Tier 1 capital as a consequence. 
We have always said that the G-SIB calculation is 
nonsensical as it is not risk-based at all. It drives 
absurd behavior, such as favoring various acquisi-
tions that may be imprudent but don’t require 
G-SIB capital or encouraging very risky loans that 
require no more G-SIB capital than risk-free 
loans. Being a large, diversified company, with 
strong revenue and profit streams, is normally a 
source of strength in troubled times, but this is a 
negative in regard to G-SIB capital. Even though 
American banks are performing well today, these 
extra capital requirements we are required to 
meet will have long-term negative consequences.
This extra capital is a drag on our return on equity 
(ROE), effectively reducing whatever our ROE 
would be by approximately 15% (hypothetically, 
our 17% target should be 20%). As a result, the 
dilemma is this: Do we restrict our growth and our 
ability to serve our clients in order to reduce our 
capital requirements over time and seek a higher 
ROE or do we invest our capital to grow with our 
clients (and in many cases remain competitive) 
and accept a permanently lower ROE? 
BANKS NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE 
DRAMATICALLY CHANGING COMPETITIVE 
LANDSCAPE. 
If banks want to compete in this new and increas-
ingly competitive world, they need to acknowl-
edge the truth of this new landscape and 
respond appropriately — sometimes it truly is 
change or die. 
As they adopt new technologies like cloud, artifi-
cial intelligence (AI) and digital platforms, banks 
may have an advantage in being able to leverage 
their large customer base to offer increasingly 
comprehensive products and services, often at no 
additional cost. While many fintech companies 
specialize in one area, you already see many fin-
techs moving in this direction — trying to deepen 
and broaden their client relationships. 
The chart on the preceding page shows the exten-
sive number of services we already offer to our 
customers — many of which, depending on the 
product and customer relationship, are at no 
additional cost. 
We have always invested for the future, and that 
is even more true today than it has been in the 
past. But the principle is the same — constantly 
invest and innovate to ensure our future 
prosperity.

Investments and Acquisitions: 
Determining the Best Use of 
Capital and Assessing ROIs
We have always said that a steady and increasing 
dividend along with reinvestment in one’s own 
business — organically and inorganically, offen-
sively and defensively — are the highest and best 
use of capital. Reinvestment would ordinarily 
come before stock buybacks unless the stock is 
extraordinarily cheap. And we generally only buy 
back stock when we don’t see a clear need for the 
capital over the next few years. 
In fact, stock buybacks at our company will be 
lower in the next year or so because we may need 
to retain more capital due to required capital 
increases (which, by any real measure, we defi-
nitely do not need) and because we have made 
some good acquisitions that we believe will 
enhance the future of our company.
We try to be rigorous in how we invest for the 
future. Above all, we try to free up our capital 
and capabilities with the following in mind:  
1) we reduce complexity in our company and  
simplify as much as possible; 2) we periodically 
assess and eliminate hobbies (which have a dan-
ger all their own); and 3) we assess investments 
and activities that seemed good when we started 
them but are not working out as planned. How-
ever, some things simply are complex (like air-
planes, pharmaceuticals, technology and bank-
ing) but worthwhile — and in fact necessary to 
compete. We don’t let fear of that complexity  
stop us from investing. 
Before we talk about different types of invest-
ments, we should recognize that our most impor-
tant asset — far more important than capital — is 
the quality of our people.
We announced earlier in the year that our total 
expenses would increase by approximately $6  
billion. Of that amount, $2.5 billion is mostly 
related to people, reflecting both inflationary and 
competitive labor market dynamics. (We have 
been quite adamant that we will do what is neces-
sary to retain talent — we cannot be one of the 
best companies without having some of the best 
talent.) Included in this $2.5 billion are certain 
expenses (think travel and entertainment) as 
economies have reopened. 
In this section of the letter, I am going to focus on 
investments — describing how and why we do 
them and offering a few examples. We have 
always believed that investing continuously and 
rigorously for the future is critical for our ongoing 
success. This year, we announced that the 
expenses related to investments would increase 
from $11.5 billion to $15 billion. I am going to try 
to describe the “incremental investments” of  
$3.5 billion, though I can’t review them all (and 
for competitive reasons I wouldn’t). But we hope 
a few examples will give you comfort in our  
decision-making process. 
SOME INVESTMENTS GENERATE 
PREDICTABLE RETURNS. 
Some investments have a fairly predictable time 
to cash flow positive and a good and predictable 
return on investment (ROI) however you measure 
it. These investments include branches and bank-
ers, around the world, across all our businesses. 
They also include certain marketing expenses, 
which have a known and quantifiable return.  
This category combined will add $1 billion to our 
expenses in 2022.
33
INVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS: DETERMINING THE BEST USE OF CAPITAL AND ASSESSING ROIs
Our shareholders should also know that when we 
make investments like these, we incorporate 
through-the-cycle thinking — we don’t only look 
at current margins and charge-offs but also eval-
uate what we expect them to be over the next 
several years. 
ACQUISITIONS SHOULD PAY FOR 
THEMSELVES — AND EACH ONE HAS ITS 
OWN LOGIC.
Acquisitions generally extend products, add ser-
vices or bring in technology that we would have 
had to otherwise build ourselves. These acquisi-
tions are described in more detail in the letters 
from the other CEOs included in this report. Over 
the last 18 months, we spent nearly $5 billion on 
acquisitions, which will increase “incremental 
investment” expenses by approximately $700 
million in 2022. 
We expect most of these acquisitions to produce 
positive returns and strong earnings within a few 
years, fully justifying their cost. In a few cases, 
these acquisitions earn money — plus, we believe, 
help stave off erosion in other parts of our busi-
ness. Importantly, on an ongoing basis, many of 
our acquisitions will be relatively capital-lite, 
meaning they can grow over time but require  
little additional regulatory capital. 
WE WANT TO BUILD UPON OUR GLOBAL 
FOOTPRINT. 
While we don’t disclose our investment here, our 
international consumer expansion is an invest-
ment of a different nature. We believe the digital 
world gives us an opportunity to build a con-
sumer bank outside the United States that, over 
time, can become very competitive — an option 
that does not exist in the physical world. We  
start with several advantages that we believe  
will get stronger over time: a global brand, with 
long-term capital and staying power; a global 
Payments business; an international Private 
Bank; global Asset Management products; and 
best-in-class trading platforms. We have the  
talent and know-how to deliver these through 
cutting-edge technology, allowing us to harness 
the full range of these capabilities from all our 
businesses. We can apply what we have learned 
in our leading U.S. franchise and vice versa. We 
may be wrong on this one, but I like our hand.
WE MAKE EXTENSIVE INVESTMENTS IN 
TECHNOLOGY FOR A BROAD RANGE OF 
REASONS, FROM IMPROVING 
OPERATIONS AND SECURITY TO 
ENHANCING OUR PRODUCTS AND 
SERVICES. 
Investments in technology and operations, as 
well as related products and services, are the 
most complicated category. Some of these invest-
ments simply must be done to sustain the compa-
ny’s health. Investments in this bucket help keep 
the ship in tip-top shape and touch a broad range 
of workplace needs: regulatory requirements and 
necessary improvements for cybersecurity, as 
well as operational resiliency and security. Some 
things we have done with no direct revenue ben-
efit, rather simply to maintain our competitive 
position. I call these table stakes — think of  
digital account opening for consumer and small 
business accounts. Other investments are specific 
improvements to products and services, often 
with identifiable benefits. Finally, there are  
specific investments in this category that are 
more like forward-looking R&D, as described  
in the examples that follow. 
Combined, this category will add a little bit less 
than $2 billion to our “incremental investment” 
expenses in 2022 (the actual expense lines could 
be for people, hardware or software, or pur-
chased services). Almost all of the $2 billion in 
expenses are analyzed and studied for their ROI 
or other significant benefits.
Sometimes people refer to some of these 
expenses as modernizing or adopting new tech-
nologies. I prefer not to talk about it that way 
because, effectively, we have been modernizing 
my entire life. Also, the term implies that once 
you get to a modern platform, these expenses 
should dramatically decrease — which is rarely 
34
INVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS: DETERMINING THE BEST USE OF CAPITAL AND ASSESSING ROIs
the case. In fact, when we analyze these 
expenses, we incorporate not only the cost to 
build the product or service but also the cost to 
maintain it going forward. Furthermore, once you 
have built the new platforms, they generally cre-
ate a whole new set of investment opportunities 
to be analyzed. Technology always drives change, 
but now the waves of technological innovation 
come in faster and faster. The science behind 
them is also increasingly complex as technology 
(including AI) is “embedded” in more products.  
In today’s world, I cannot overemphasize the 
importance of implementing new technology.
We hope a few examples will explain how these 
expenses are managed. To do so, we are going to 
talk about two different types of investments that 
are clearly related: infrastructure and software.
First, on the path to new and modern infrastruc-
ture, cloud-based systems, whether private or 
public, will ultimately be faster, cheaper, more 
flexible and also AI-enabled — all extremely  
valuable features. A few other additional details:  
• We have spent $2.2 billion building new, cloud-
based data centers. Our total expensed cost  
of data centers is higher than in previous years 
— mostly because of the duplicative expense 
that is generated as we run both the new and 
older centers. 
• Thousands of applications (and their related 
databases) are being replatformed and refac-
tored to run in the private and public cloud envi-
ronment. To give you an example: We migrated 
our Card mainframe to the new data center and 
are already seeing approximately 20% faster 
response times for our major customer-facing 
applications. This one application will use only 
1.5% of the capacity of our new data centers:  
Of our more than 5,000 applications that will 
still be in use in two years, 40% will have been 
replatformed. 
• These “infrastructure” costs include things like 
modernizing developer tools and embedding 
operational resiliency and cybersecurity controls. 
Second, much of our “incremental investment” 
technology spend involves building software for 
new products and services. There are hundreds 
of these, large and small. Again, a few examples 
will describe the process: 
• In certain product areas, we made large, multi-
year investments to improve a specific busi-
ness. In Payments, we have been investing con-
sistently over the past five years to modernize 
our businesses and compete with both banks 
and fintech companies. Since 2016, we have 
invested more than $1.5 billion in technology, 
operations, sales, products and controls and 
generated an incremental $4 billion in organic 
revenue annually, taking our overall market 
share in Treasury Services from 4.5% in 2016 
to 7.2% in 2021. In 2021, we continued this 
strong momentum, initiating a large majority of 
all real-time payments in the United States in 
our cloud-native, faster payments platform, 
which is now live in 45 countries. We are also 
winning more than 80% of all global bids that 
include virtual account solutions available on 
our liquidity platform.
We now process payments for eight of the top 
10 global Big Tech companies (up from three 
out of 10 companies five years ago), consis-
tently winning business from strong competi-
tors. We continue to bring to the market and 
commercialize innovative products, such as 
embedded banking; AI-driven fraud controls 
and forecasting; and account validation and 
programmable payments on JPM Coin. Decen-
tralized finance and blockchain are real, new 
technologies that can be deployed in both pub-
lic and private fashion, permissioned or not. 
JPMorgan Chase is at the forefront of this inno-
vation. We use a blockchain network called 
Liink to enable banks to share complex infor-
mation, and we also use a blockchain to move 
tokenized U.S. dollar deposits with JPM Coin. 
We believe there are many uses where a block-
chain can replace or improve contracts, data 
ownership and other enhancements; for some 
purposes, however, it is currently too expensive 
or too slow to be deployed. 
35
INVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS: DETERMINING THE BEST USE OF CAPITAL AND ASSESSING ROIs
We expect to achieve double-digit market 
share over time in Payments, being the world’s 
most innovative bank, as well as the safest  
and most resilient.
• We built the capability for our Self-Directed 
Investing, which now has 800,000 new invest-
ment accounts totaling nearly $60 billion on 
the platform. We are excited to enhance and 
roll out this product to all of our customers, as 
we think it is a critical offering in today’s new 
competitive environment.
• Increasingly, we are investing more money 
(think hundreds of millions of dollars) each year 
on AI for very specific purposes. For example, 
we use AI to generate insights on existing and 
prospective clients from public information, 
such as KYC protocols, regulatory filings, social 
media, news, public websites and documents. 
Once standardized, the information is then 
applied to multiple uses, such as generating 
leads, identifying companies and investors, 
onboarding clients, and detecting environmen-
tal, social and governance (ESG) themes. In all 
of these cases, there are identifiable returns 
due to lower prospecting costs or improved 
services. One specific example will suffice:
— In the consumer world, we have spent about 
$100 million since 2017 on AI, machine  
learning and other technology initiatives to 
improve fraud risk systems. We know this 
investment is working. Our annual fraud 
losses have come down 14% since 2017 
despite volumes being up almost 50%, and 
we estimate that our technology investments 
alone have contributed about $100 million in 
annual savings. 
• We have developed over 1,000 application pro-
gramming interfaces that give various types of 
customers access to our systems in a controlled 
way, allowing them to automate our banking 
systems into their enterprise systems. 
• There are plenty of forward-looking and exciting 
R&D investments, too. For example, we are 
working on several research-based projects that 
have the potential for significant future impact. 
These involve multi-agent simulation, synthetic 
data and encryption methods — elements that 
have the capacity to unlock new ways of trading, 
managing risk and assessing productivity. Multi-
agent simulations, for example, enable the 
exploration of strategies that can handle chal-
lenging regimes as variations of novel historical 
data. Synthetic data, well-calibrated by real 
data, enables effective testing, experimentation 
and development without triggering privacy and 
regulatory restrictions associated with using 
real data. Encryption methods give us better 
tools to protect our clients’ privacy and also 
equip us with the necessary techniques to  
handle the metaverse. This category also 
includes investment in the critical area of  
quantum computing.
While we measure each of these incremental 
investments (and there are hundreds of them) as 
diligently as we can, you can assess the overall 
results by asking the following questions: Do we 
maintain the competitiveness of our products?  
Are we gaining market share? Do we have real wins 
against some tough competitors, both in the bank-
ing world and in fintech companies? What are our 
customer satisfaction scores? Have we built won-
derful new products, like Credit Journey and Self-
Directed Investing, that may not generate revenue 
but clearly have improved our business? How are 
our products serving our clients’ needs to access 
our systems how and when they want? 
Finally, also consider: Is the bank sustaining its 
overall competitive position, growing at pace and 
still maintaining a very healthy return on tangible 
common equity while investing for the future? We 
hope you will see some great new and exciting 
products and services this year.

INVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS: DETERMINING THE BEST USE OF CAPITAL AND ASSESSING ROIs
Updates on Specific Issues 
Facing Our Company
WE ARE VIGILANT AGAINST CYBER 
ATTACKS.
As we have highlighted in previous letters,  
we cannot overemphasize how cyber threats pose 
extreme hazards to our company and our country. 
This has become even more evident as the cost of 
ransomware has increased dramatically (cyber 
attacks may have caused the death of some peo-
ple as hospitals could not provide the necessary 
procedures). And it is evident to everyone, with 
the war in Ukraine, that grave damage could be 
inflicted if cyber is widely used as a tool of war. 
We believe that our company has some of the best 
cyber protections in place, as well as the best  
talent to monitor and guard our information. We 
also work extensively, and increasingly, with the 
appropriate agencies of the U.S. government to 
help protect the financial system and the country.
OUR COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY IS 
INFORMED BY ENERGY REALITIES. 
Despite the growth in well-intended climate 
pledges from governments and companies, the 
world is well short of meeting its net zero emis-
sions goals by 2050. But the war in Ukraine and 
sanctions on Russia are driving gasoline prices up 
and threatening Europe’s access to natural gas. 
Resource scarcity leads to higher energy costs and 
reduces reliability, hindering national security and 
hurting the most vulnerable. Disruptions to the 
global energy system are again highlighting our 
urgent global need to provide energy resources 
securely, reliably and affordably and, at the same 
time, address long-term clean energy solutions 
and strategies to reduce our carbon footprint. 
These objectives are not mutually exclusive.  
We can — and must — do both. 
To begin, we need to find a better way forward 
that can bring diverse stakeholders together in 
pursuit of the North Star: another “Marshall Plan” 
(as described earlier). Here are four ways to 
jump-start that process:
• First, we must promote energy security. Con-
straining the flow of capital needed to produce 
and move fuels, especially as the war in Ukraine 
rages on, is a bad idea. The world still needs oil 
and natural gas today, but not all hydrocarbons 
are equal when it comes to their carbon foot-
print. We should be directing more capital 
toward less carbon-intensive fuel sources and 
investing in innovations, such as carbon capture 
and sequestration, as we look to transition to 
green technologies delivered at scale for soci-
ety. Our company is firmly committed to helping 
finance these kinds of investments and expedit-
ing the use of lower-carbon fuels. This is why we 
established the Center for Carbon Transition, 
centralizing client access to financing, advisory 
and research solutions to help them make the 
low-carbon transition and thrive.
• Second, we need to scale investment massively 
in clean technologies. As the International 
Energy Agency has emphasized, “huge leaps in 
clean energy innovation” are core to achieving 
net zero. This is because the world will rely on 
traditional fuels until alternatives, like clean 
hydrogen, are fully available. To accelerate 
progress, JPMorgan Chase has a goal of financ-
ing and facilitating $1 trillion by 2030 to 
advance climate action — supporting initiatives 
such as renewable energy, green buildings and 
vehicle electrification. 
• Third, governments should play a leadership 
role by enacting thoughtful policies that spur 
long-term and large-scale capital deployment 
for low-carbon solutions that create jobs and 
benefit the global economy. Here are some 
examples: a carbon tax that directs some pro-
ceeds to help offset energy costs for under-
37
UPDATES ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY
served communities; measures to promote 
investment in technology R&D; and reductions 
in permitting timelines for energy infrastruc-
ture, such as wind and solar farms and lique-
fied natural gas. 
• Finally, let’s set meaningful goals and identify a 
few tangible, cost-effective solutions to reduce 
emissions today. This should include minimizing 
fugitive methane emissions and virtually elimi-
nating wasteful flaring of natural gas. Immedi-
ately actionable opportunities like these might 
require more financing, not less, to reduce the 
short-term rate of climate change and prepare 
companies to thrive in a lower-carbon future.  
In 2021, JPMorgan Chase set 2030 targets to 
reduce the carbon intensity of our financing 
portfolio, starting with oil and gas, electric 
power and automotive manufacturing — with 
more to come. 
There is no silver bullet to meet the world’s 
energy and climate goals. But we can start by pri-
oritizing emissions reductions, developing mean-
ingful short- and long-term goals and crafting 
innovative policy solutions. The curve toward net 
zero can still be bent before it’s too late. 
PROGRESS CONTINUES IN OUR DIVERSITY, 
EQUITY AND INCLUSION EFFORTS.
We’ve made tremendous progress over the past 
few years to create a more inclusive company and 
promote equity in all our communities. The work is 
not easy, but we are as committed as ever to doing 
what is right and just. I’ll spotlight a few areas of 
focus and describe the progress we’ve made. 
A More Diverse Workforce
We continue to believe that if our team is more 
diverse, we will generate better ideas and better 
outcomes, enjoy a stronger corporate culture and 
outperform our competitors. This appears to be 
proving true. 
Despite the pandemic and talent retention chal-
lenges, we continue to boost our representation 
among women and people of color. Here are 
some examples: 
• More women were promoted to the position of 
managing director in 2021 than ever before; 
similarly, a record number of women were  
promoted to executive director. By year’s end, 
based on employees who self-identified, 
women represented 49% of the firm’s total 
workforce. Overall Hispanic representation was 
20%, Asian representation grew to 17% and 
Black representation increased to 14%. 
• We expanded our global Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion department to include three new  
Centers of Excellence: Advancing Hispanics and 
Latinos, The Office of Asian and Pacific Islander 
Affairs, and The Office of LGBT+ Affairs. 
• To promote greater participation in our work-
force by Black professionals, we expanded our 
Historically Black Colleges and Universities 
partnerships to 17 schools across the United 
States to boost recruitment connections, 
expand student career pathways, and support 
long-term student development and financial 
health.
• We continue to find ways to lift our LGBT+ 
employees, professionals with disabilities and 
military veteran colleagues. We just celebrated 
the 10th anniversary of the Veteran Jobs  
Mission, which is a coalition JPMorgan Chase 
co-founded in 2011 as the 100,000 Jobs  
Mission. It began as 11 companies committed to 
hiring military talent across the private sector, 
and now membership exceeds 300 companies 
with more than 830,000 veterans hired.
Finally, I want to be clear: We oppose any and all 
forms of discrimination against anyone. Being 
the bank of choice for all is our goal — and we 
want everyone to feel welcome here and be able 
to contribute to our core mission to the best of 
their ability.

An Update on Our $30 Billion Racial Equity 
Commitment
The murder of George Floyd in 2020 highlighted 
what we already knew: More was required by all 
of us to address systemic racism. In October 
2020, less than five months after his tragic mur-
der, our company made a five-year, $30 billion 
commitment to help close the racial wealth gap. 
We committed to trying new things and putting 
the full force of our firm behind solutions that 
could really make an impact. 
By the end of 2021, we had deployed or commit-
ted more than $18 billion toward our goal. That 
commitment focuses on increasing homeowner-
ship, expanding affordable rental housing and 
growing small businesses, spending more with 
Black, Hispanic and Latino suppliers, improving 
financial health and access to banking, investing 
in minority depository institutions (MDI) and com-
munity development financial institutions (CDFI), 
and investing in communities through philan-
thropic capital. Here are some details on our 
progress to date: 
• Supplier Diversity: In 2021, we spent an addi-
tional $155 million with 140 Black, Hispanic and 
Latino suppliers — more than doubling the first-
year spend goal and increasing the number of 
new Black, Hispanic and Latino suppliers by 
more than 40% over 2020. 
• Affordable Rental Housing: We approved  
funding of approximately $13 billion in loans  
to create and preserve more than 100,000  
affordable housing and rental units across  
the United States.
• Homeownership: We established a Community 
and Affordable Home Lending business, hiring 
over 150 Community Home Lending Advisors 
and expanding the Chase Homebuyer Grant to 
$5,000 to help cover customers’ closing costs 
and down payments for homes purchased in 
6,700 minority neighborhoods nationwide. 
• Small Business: We hired 25 diverse senior 
business consultants to provide free one-on-
one coaching for minority business owners in 
14 U.S. cities and to mentor more than 1,000 
small businesses.
• MDIs: We invested more than $100 million in 
equity in 16 diverse financial institutions that 
serve nearly 90 communities in 19 states and 
the District of Columbia.
• CDFIs: We provided more than $190 million in 
incremental financing to CDFIs to support com-
munities that lack access to traditional financing. 
• Access to Banking: We helped more than 
200,000 customers open low-cost checking 
accounts with no overdraft fees; opened 10 
Community Center branches (the sidebar that 
follows includes more details about this initia-
tive), often in areas with larger Black, Hispanic 
and Latino populations; and hired over 100 
Community Managers in underserved commu-
nities to build relationships with community 
leaders, nonprofits and small businesses.
Our dedication to racial equity is not simply a 
five-year effort. We might not always get it right, 
but we are committed to advancing racial equity 
and sharing our progress on the journey.

Community Building through Community Banking
Americans have lost trust in the ability 
of large institutions like the federal gov-
ernment, national media and big compa-
nies — even big banks — to understand or 
care about their needs. This view is well 
earned, particularly among communities 
of color and low-income households. 
Simply put, our country has done a bad 
job of looking out for and creating oppor-
tunity for everyone. We need to consider 
more thoughtfully the unique needs of 
communities across the United States. 
Companies of all sizes need to show up, 
listen, and make the right investments 
and decisions to earn a neighborhood’s 
trust. And it needs to be done on the 
ground and in the community itself to be 
authentic and sustainable. Impact is most 
effective when it is local. 
A local bank branch, especially in a low-
income neighborhood, can be successful 
only when it fits the community’s needs. 
That is why over the last several years 
we have shifted our approach to how we 
offer access to financial health educa-
tion, as well as low-cost products and 
services, to help build wealth, especially 
in Black, Hispanic and Latino communi-
ties. We are delivering this approach 
through our Community Center 
branches, unique spaces in the heart of 
urban communities. Beginning with Har-
lem in New York City and Ventura Village 
in Minneapolis, we have opened 10 more 
Community Center branches in neighbor-
hoods like Stony Island in the South 
Shore of Chicago, Crenshaw in Los Ange-
les, and Wards 7 and 8 in Washington, 
D.C. Ten of these branches were opened 
since we announced our $30 billion com-
mitment to racial equity in October 
2020. These branches have more space 
to host grassroots community events, 
small business mentoring sessions and 
financial health seminars. The majority 
were built with minority contractors, 
and we hire local artists to make these 
locations complement their neighbor-
hoods. With branches expanding to 
Atlanta, Baltimore, Miami, Philadelphia 
and Tulsa, we expect to have 17 Commu-
nity Center branches serving customers 
in underserved communities by the end 
of 2022. 
The Community Manager, a new role 
within the bank, primarily functions as a 
local ambassador to build and nurture 
relationships with community leaders, 
nonprofit partners and small businesses. 
We have now hired over 100 Community 
Managers in underserved communities 
and intend to keep growing that number. 
Our Community Managers have hosted 
more than 1,300 financial health events 
with over 36,000 people in attendance 
and have participated in 600+ community 
service events. We want people who live 
and work in these communities to feel 
welcome and included when they visit our 
branches. We ask them to come as they 
are and bring the family or their dog. 
They are also likely to know the employ-
ees in the branch, as we hire locally — 
people who live in the community and 
care about serving their neighbors. 
I’ve attended many grand openings of our 
Community Center branches in person. 
The energy is contagious. We’ve hosted 
mayors, community partners, students 
and small business customers who have 
shared their sense of pride and optimism 
about what these branches mean for their 
community. Our Community Managers 
are always front and center at these 
events, connecting people to one another 
and forging new relationships. 
We know that to be sustainable, this 
effort must be measured by results. Our 
company is closely tracking the number 
of accounts opened, the number of 
mortgages funded, the pace and scale of 
new small business loans extended, and 
a host of other metrics to ensure that we 
are achieving results and listening to 
feedback so we can have even greater 
impact. In October 2021, we published a 
detailed report on our racial equity ini-
tiatives, including our Community Center 
branches and Community Managers, 
which we intend to continue to provide, 
letting others learn from our experience. 
We’re also taking a local approach to our 
community investments and advocating 
for local policy solutions. Our business is 
only as strong as our communities, so  
we increased our investments in places 
like Mattapan in Boston and Oak Cliff in  
Dallas to help local minority small busi-
nesses access the capital and support 
they need to grow. We’ve expanded our 
homebuyer grant program, which pro-
vides $5,000 to cover closing costs and 
down payments when customers buy 
homes in 6,700 minority neighborhoods 
nationwide. We are also looking at alter-
native credit scores and other ways to 
increase homeownership in underserved 
communities and build generational 
wealth and stability. 
We call this going from “community 
banking” to “community building,” and it 
is an important evolution in serving com-
munities where it is long overdue. While 
it is early, our approach has the promise 
to create real local impact.

MORGAN HEALTH IS HELPING US LEAD IN 
HEALTHCARE TRANSFORMATION.
JPMorgan Chase spends $39 billion on compensa-
tion and benefits for our 270,000+ employees.  
Of that amount, about $1.5 billion is directed to 
medical costs for our employees and their fami-
lies — approximately 460,000 people. Our 
employees also spend approximately $500 million 
on their own medical care. Medical care costs 
may be our most important benefit costs because 
they have a critical impact on the health and well-
being of our employees and their families. As our 
employees remain our most valuable asset, 
improving the quality and delivery of healthcare 
services is a high priority. 
Managing the complexities of healthcare is stag-
gering, whether you are an individual or a corpo-
ration — from coping with actual health issues 
(covering the spectrum of a bad back to diabetes 
to cancer) and locating suitable primary or spe-
cialist care to deciphering incomprehensible 
insurance plans and pricing, resolving excessive 
surprise bills and other issues. While the U.S. 
healthcare system is exceptional in many ways,  
it also has many flaws that must be addressed. 
Healthcare costs, which are already the highest in 
the world, continue to rise (average premiums for 
family coverage have increased 22% since 2016) 
for both employers and employees — with no evi-
dence that outcomes are improving (e.g., only 
46.5% of adults with private insurance have their 
blood pressure controlled, and that number has 
declined in the last 10 years). 
This is why, in 2021, we launched Morgan Health, 
a new business unit. With Morgan Health, we have 
an opportunity to deliver and scale new health-
care models that improve the quality, equity and 
affordability of employer-sponsored healthcare. 
We’re focused on connecting healthcare to 
improved health outcomes for our employees. 
JPMorgan Chase has approximately 20 talented 
people on our Human Resources Benefits team 
helping employees and their families access the 
best possible medical care. In hindsight, it is 
shocking how few people we had dedicated to this 
vitally important issue. With Morgan Health, we 
are adding approximately 30 more individuals 
who will help our Benefits team attack this prob-
lem from many different angles. 
Looking forward, Morgan Health is investing  
$250 million to accelerate the development and 
delivery of accountable care (managing a patient’s 
total care from prevention to outcomes), complet-
ing its first $50 million investment in Vera Whole 
Health — and its subsequent investment in Cast-
light — with plans to deploy these services to our 
employees in Columbus, Ohio, this year. Morgan 
Health just completed another investment in 
healthcare analytics company Embold Health, 
which will help facilitate how consumers access 
the highest-quality care available. We are also 
working toward providing equal access to equal 
healthcare, regardless of race, income or other 
personal characteristics for our employees and in 
the communities we serve. Addressing inequities 
in healthcare is fundamental to Morgan Health’s 
strategy, and our partnership with Kaiser Perman-
ente in California is moving forward quickly on its 
collaborative effort focused on the collection and 
reporting of health equity performance metrics. 
WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT DATA-DRIVEN 
POLICYMAKING THROUGH THE 
JPMORGAN CHASE POLICYCENTER AND 
INSTITUTE. 
Last year, I wrote that one lesson of leadership is 
putting in place good decision-making processes. 
An essential part of that is good data because 
the challenges we face are complex and intercon-
nected. Too often, decision makers use “facts” to 
justify a pre-existing point of view or do not 
accurately represent reality. Good data that is 
granular and timely and, when possible, lever-
ages big data sources must be at the heart of all 
policy processes to ensure measurable and equi-
table outcomes. 
Six years ago, we created the JPMorgan Chase 
Institute to deliver unique data and insights to 
help solve some of our most pressing economic 
challenges. This information offers a unique lens 
into the financial habits of millions of small busi-
nesses and households, leveraging anonymized 
and aggregated customer data that represents 
41
UPDATES ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY
half of U.S. households. The Institute’s data and 
analyses have helped policymakers better under-
stand the impact of decisions — ranging from  
student loan relief and targeted investments in 
underserved Chicago and Detroit neighborhoods 
to small business support and insights about how 
families manage income volatility and use their tax 
refunds. Importantly, the Institute has also helped 
shape some of our own products and employee 
benefits, including how we incentivize customers 
to save more money and reduce health insurance 
deductibles for our lower-paid employees.
The Institute’s work has also helped inform our 
policy advocacy efforts that support inclusive 
growth. Two years ago, we launched the JPMorgan 
Chase PolicyCenter to drive this work. Grounded 
in data, we are developing and advocating for 
policy aimed at reducing structural barriers to 
economic mobility and broadening opportunity 
for millions of families who live on the financial 
margins and have been most impacted by COVID-
19. For example, as Congress was debating 
expanded unemployment benefits, our research 
showed how these benefits had boosted spending 
and stimulated economic activity during COVID-
19. Additional research has provided insight  
into household balances, cutting across income 
levels and providing an important barometer  
on how households are faring as government  
support expires. 
This work is not easy, but we believe it’s impera-
tive that policymaking include private and public 
sector partnership. We continue to need better 
data to understand what is happening in the real 
economy so we can help shape policies that make 
a significant and positive impact on those who 
need help the most. 
WE JOIN OTHER COMPANIES IN EVOLVING 
OUR VISION OF THE WORKPLACE.
Today, in many places COVID-19 has moved from 
pandemic to endemic status, although there is 
still suffering in some parts of the world. And we 
are cognizant that the risk of new variants is real 
and that if they occur, we will need to take appro-
priate action.
As a company, while we continually prepare for 
multiple business resiliency scenarios (e.g., data 
center failures, closures of cities, major storms, 
even widespread disease), we never fully pre-
pared for a pandemic that entailed a large-scale 
shutdown of the global economy. Although some 
of our employees, particularly in the branches, 
continued to work on our premises every day, we 
quickly set up the technology — ranging from call 
centers and operations to trading and investment 
banking — that enabled many of our employees to 
work from home. We learned that we could func-
tion virtually with Zoom and Cisco and maintain 
productivity, at least in the short run. 
Although the pandemic changed the way we work 
in many ways, for the most part it only acceler-
ated ongoing trends. While it’s clear that working 
from home will become more permanent in 
American business, such arrangements also need 
to work for both the company and its clients. I 
believe our firm’s on-site versus remote work will 
sort out something like this: 
• Generally speaking, many employees (approxi-
mately 50%) will necessarily work at a location 
full time. That would include nearly all employ-
ees in our retail bank branches, as well as jobs 
in check processing, vaults, sales and trading, 
critical operations functions and facilities, 
amenities, security, medical and many others. 
• Some employees (approximately 40%) will 
work under a hybrid model (e.g., some days on-
site and other days at home). Increased flexibil-
ity and hybrid working arrangements will vary 
by job type. We do hope to provide these types 
of arrangements where they are appropriate 
and for those who want them.
42
UPDATES ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY
• A small percentage of employees, possibly 
10%, may work full time from home in very 
specific roles.
In all situations, these decisions depend upon 
what is optimal for our company and our  
clients, and we will extensively monitor and ana-
lyze outcomes to ensure this is the case.  
As we reopen, and we mostly are, we will, of 
course, follow government guidelines. 
Remote work will change how we manage our 
real estate. We will quickly move to a more “open 
seating” arrangement in which digital tools will 
help manage seating arrangements (people will 
have regular neighborhoods where they can con-
gregate), as well as needed amenities, such as 
conference room space. As a result, for every 100 
employees, we may need seats for approximately 
60 to 75 on average — with an appropriate 
increase in conference room, private office and 
amenity space to make it a great work 
environment.
The virtual world also presents some serious 
weaknesses. For example: 
• Performing jobs remotely is more successful 
when people know one another and already 
have a large body of existing work to do. It 
does not work as well when people don’t know 
each other. 
• Most professionals learn their job through an 
apprenticeship model, which is almost impos-
sible to replicate in the Zoom world. Since the 
onset of COVID-19, JPMorgan Chase has hired 
over 80,000 new people into the company — 
and we are making sure they are properly 
trained on all aspects of our business, from 
their special role to the significance of conduct 
and culture. But this is harder to do over Zoom. 
Over time, this drawback could dramatically 
undermine the character and culture you want 
to promote in your company. 
• A heavy reliance on Zoom meetings actually 
slows down decision making because there is 
less immediate follow-up.
• Remote work eliminates much spontaneous 
learning and creativity because you don’t run 
into people at the coffee machine, talk with  
clients in unplanned scenarios or travel to meet 
with customers and employees for feedback on 
your products and services. 
• Finally, the negative effects of the weaknesses 
outlined above are cumulative — they weren’t 
as obvious earlier in the pandemic — and they 
get worse over time.
We are moving full steam ahead with building our 
new headquarters in New York City. We will, of 
course, consolidate even more employees into 
this building, which will house between 12,000 
and 14,000 people. We are extremely excited 
about the building’s public spaces, state-of-the-
art technology, and health and wellness ameni-
ties, among many other features. It’s in the best 
location in one of the world’s greatest cities.
Two final points. Of our total overhead of $71  
billion, $39 billion represents our people costs. 
Over time, using lots of data, surveys and other 
metrics, we believe we can gain efficiencies while 
still keeping our people happy, healthy and moti-
vated, at an increasingly lower cost. 
And finally, our leaders must lead. They have to 
walk the floors, they must see clients, they need 
to be visible, they need to teach and educate, and 
they need to be able to conduct impromptu meet-
ings. They cannot lead from behind a desk or in 
front of a screen.

MANAGEMENT LESSON: THE BENEFIT OF PURPOSE AND THE TREMENDOUS VALUE OF WORK
Management Lesson: The 
Benefit of Purpose and the 
Tremendous Value of Work
Great management and leadership are critical to 
any large organization’s long-term success, 
whether it is a company or a country. Strong 
management is disciplined and rigorous. Facts, 
analysis, detail … facts, analysis, detail … repeat. 
You can never do enough, and it does not end. 
But creating an exceptional management team is 
an art, not a science.
In the section on Investments, I described what 
we consider our most important investment: our 
people, who in accounting terms are not even 
considered an asset. But we all understand the 
value of building a great team.
In the rest of this section, I talk about some man-
agement lessons — I always enjoy sharing what I 
have learned over time by watching others and 
through my own successes and failures. 
PERFECT YOUR PICASSO — HAVE 
SOMETHING TO STRIVE FOR AND 
MOTIVATE YOU.
It seems to me that people are happier and more 
motivated when they have a passion, a moral pur-
pose, something they are devoted to — when they 
are painting their own Picasso, striving for some-
thing. Some people find it in religion, the military, 
teaching, science, athletics, parenthood, entre-
preneurship or simply being their best at their 
craft. Whatever it is, all these things combined — 
when done well — create a wonderful society. And 
most people I know get an enormous sense of 
satisfaction from the exploration and learning 
that take place on the journey.
Personally and professionally, I am motivated by 
the desire to leave the world a better place — if I 
do my job well, this company can do so much for 
individuals, shareholders, communities, countries 
and humanity. I am motivated when I see our cus-
tomers and employees in action, knowing there is 
increased opportunity for each of them when we 
do better as a company. I am motivated when I go 
to our annual National Achievers Conference, 
which recognizes some of our most successful 
bankers and managers in the branches. Some-
times they have tears in their eyes as they accept 
this recognition — many have never been recog-
nized before — and it is hard to describe how this 
deepens my own sense of responsibility.
RECOGNIZE THE TREMENDOUS VALUE  
OF WORK.
Work, all work, has value. It was a beautiful thing 
during the onset of COVID-19 when we celebrated 
our essential workers (in New York City, it was 
unbelievable to hear the sound of 1 million New 
Yorkers shouting thanks out their windows every 
evening at 7:00), including nurses, firefighters, 
emergency medical service staff, sanitation work-
ers and police officers (although recently that 
spirit seems to have waned). They were always 
essential workers, and they appreciated our 
recognition. 
Along the same lines, some in society diminish 
“starter” jobs, such as cashiers, office workers, 
bank tellers, fast food cooks and others. These 
“starter” jobs bring dignity, provide security for 
many families and create a solid work ethic. 
Often, they result in better social outcomes in 
terms of reductions in drug use and crime, similar 
to outcomes we have seen from summer youth 
employment. For many, these jobs are the first 
rung on the career ladder, leading to bigger and 
bigger jobs. For example, more than 95% of  
Domino’s franchise owners started as delivery 
drivers or pizza makers. At JPMorgan Chase, 
about one-third of our branch managers started 
as tellers or personal bankers. 
I have expressed regret for many years in this  
letter that we, as a society, have not found a way 
to better prepare our young people for jobs,

whether through conventional schooling or 
apprenticeships and skills-based training, which is 
more important today than ever before. Offering 
better training and getting more income to lower-
paid workers would hugely benefit the economy, 
the individuals involved and social outcomes — 
and would help rectify income inequality. We must 
do a better job improving the outcomes of an edu-
cation; i.e., that it leads to well-paying jobs. I also 
believe that we should immediately increase the 
minimum wage and the EITC to both entice more 
people into the workforce and to get more income 
into the hands of the lower paid.
NURTURE THE EXTRAORDINARY VALUE 
OF TRUST.
Trust is earned, given and received. To maximize 
human creativity and freedoms — which are the 
greatest gifts of capitalism — trust is essential. 
We must make it safe to argue, disagree and  
challenge each other while continuing to dig 
deeper in areas where we’re not doing as well as 
we’d like. It must be okay to fail or make mis-
takes. Trust is the force multiplier that gets the 
best out of everyone. You do not earn trust if you 
finger-point, don’t admit to your own mistakes or 
don’t share the credit.
COMBAT THE ENEMY WITHIN.
While trust is the force multiplier, a workplace 
cannot devolve into excessive, feel-good collabo-
ration and bureaucracy. I have seen work envi-
ronments in which everyone is so nice to each 
other and so collaborative that it slowly creates 
crippling bureaucracy as everyone’s opinion is 
sought out — and everyone has a veto. 
The other disease that arises from within is a 
workplace completely run by corporate head-
quarters: It is very easy to be critical of people in 
the field for their failures when you don’t walk in 
the trenches with them. 
Very often, the enemy within fights change, 
resists making bold decisions and balks at invest-
ments that are hard, such as growing the sales-
force. When the enemy within takes over, energy 
and creativity wither quickly … although it may 
take decades for the company to die. 
DRIVE HIGH PERFORMANCE, THE  
RIGHT WAY.
So how do you drive high performance while cre-
ating a safe workplace that values relationships 
built on trust and respect? The best leaders treat 
all people properly and respectfully, from clerks 
to CEOs. Everyone needs to help one another at a 
company because everyone’s collective purpose 
is to serve clients. When strong leaders consider 
promoting people, they pick those who are 
respected by their colleagues and ask them-
selves, “Would I want to work for him? Would I 
want my kid to report to her?”
We must strive for continuous improvement, set 
high standards and emphasize the negatives 
when we observe them but always remember to 
make life fun. When I travel around the world and 
see our people and our company in action, I love 
it. And you must make it fun — not only because it 
has a positive effect on retention, attitude and 
the overall culture of the company but also 
because it leads to sharing and truth-telling.
I’ve enjoyed the show “Ted Lasso.” He tries to get 
the best out of everybody, and he displays great 
gratitude. While I could get a little better at show-
ing more gratitude on a day-to-day basis with my 
management team (I did give them biscuits in lit-
tle pink boxes this year), they do know how much 
I trust, respect, appreciate and admire them.
Three additional things: You don’t create a win-
ning team by pandering to individuals. You must 
deal with conflict immediately, directly and forth-
rightly — problems do not age well. When people 
cannot do their job, they should not have that job. 
We should either work with them to find another 
role where they can thrive or ask them to leave. 
Just do it respectfully to everyone involved — do 
not embarrass people who have been working for 
the company. 
Bring energy and drive — not just every day — but 
to every meeting and interaction.
Finally, sharing credit, recognizing the contribu-
tions of others, and not casting blame or finger-
pointing all are critical to earning trust.

MANAGEMENT LESSON: THE BENEFIT OF PURPOSE AND THE TREMENDOUS VALUE OF WORK
RETAINING TALENT IS IMPORTANT AND 
SO IS LIFE OUTSIDE OF WORK.
Retaining your best talent is essential. In addition 
to being treated with enormous respect, what 
people want most is a challenging job with mean-
ingful work.  
All companies have turnover in staff, and all turn-
over is not necessarily bad. People seek out new 
challenges, may find outside advancement oppor-
tunities or may just want a change in lifestyle. 
Sometimes good people leave because they are 
getting a better opportunity or increased com-
pensation at another company. You should not be 
angry when someone receives a higher compen-
sation offer from another company. No one likes 
to feel they are being taken advantage of — 
everyone wants to go home each day thinking

they are treated fairly and equitably. And  
everyone has their own needs in terms of family, 
income, work-life balance and other factors. 
But turnover can be bad, too. It is bad when inef-
ficiency or bureaucracy or ineffective managers 
drive out good talent. It is still true that most 
people leave their job because they don’t like 
their boss. 
We also recognize and ask our employees to  
take care of their mind, body, spirit, soul, friends 
and family. While we do what we can to help 
them, we recognize that these are the most 
important things in their life, and we try to  
constantly remind them to give the needed time 
and attention to what they cherish most. 
In Closing
I would like to express my deep gratitude and appreciation for the 270,000+ 
employees, and their families, of JPMorgan Chase. From this letter, I hope 
shareholders and all readers gain an appreciation for the tremendous character 
and capabilities of our people and how they have helped communities around  
the world. They have faced these times of adversity with grace and fortitude.  
I hope you are as proud of them as I am. 
Finally, we sincerely hope that all the citizens and countries of the world see an 
end to this terrible pandemic, see an end to the war in Ukraine, and see a 
renaissance of a world on the path to peace and democracy.

rating. Excludes money market funds, Undiscovered Managers Fund and Brazil- and Korea-  
domiciled funds. Mutual fund rating services rank funds based on their risk-adjusted 
performance over various periods. A 5-star rating is the best rating and represents the top 10% 
of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked 
funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating 
represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating and

derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund’s three-, 
five-and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.-domiciled funds, separate 
star ratings are given at the individual share class level. The Nomura star rating is based on 
three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds with fewer than three years of history are not 
rated and hence excluded from this analysis. All ratings and the assigned peer categories used  
to derive this analysis are sourced from these fund rating providers as mentioned. Past

34 All quartile rankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values are sourced from the 
fund ranking providers. Quartile rankings are based on the net-of-fee absolute return of each 
fund. The data providers re-denominate the asset values into U.S. dollars. This percentage of 
assets under management is based on fund performance and associated peer rankings at the 
share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, at a primary share class level to represent the quartile 
ranking of the U.K., Luxembourg and Hong Kong funds and at the fund level for all other funds. 
The primary share class, is defined as C share class for European funds and Acc share class for 
Hong Kong and Taiwan funds. In case the share classes defined are not available, the oldest 
share class is used as the primary share class. The performance data could have been different if 
all share classes would have been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results. 
Effective September 2021 the firm has changed the peer group ranking source from Lipper  
to Morningstar for U.S.-domiciled funds (except for Municipal and Investor Funds) and 
Taiwan-domiciled funds to better align these funds to the providers and peer groups we believe 
most appropriately reflects their competitive positioning. This change may positively or 
adversely impact, substantially in some cases, the quartile rankings for one or more of these 
funds as compared with how they would have been ranked by Lipper for this reporting period or 
future reporting periods. The source for determining the rankings for all other funds remains the 
same. The classifications in terms of product suites and product engines shown are J.P. Morgan’s 
own and are based on internal investment management structures.

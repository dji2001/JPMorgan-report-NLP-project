competitors and how we look at our fortress balance sheeti invite you to peruse them at your leisurein addition i urge you to read the ceo letters in this annual report which will give you more specific details about our businesses and our plans for the futureas you know we are champions of banking’s essential role in a community — its potential for bringing people together for enabling companies and individuals to attain their goals and for being a source of strength in difficult timesas i often remind our employees the work we do matters and has impactwe help people and institutions finance and achieve their aspirations lifting up individuals homeowners small businesses larger corporations schools hospitals cities and countries in all regions of the world  steadfast principles worth repeating looking back on the past two decades — starting from my time as ceo of bank one in  — there is one common theme our unwavering dedication to help clients communities and countries throughout the worldit is clear that our financial dis cipline constant investment in innovation and ongoing development of our people are what enabled us to achieve this con sistency and commitmentin addition across the firm we uphold certain stead fast tenets that are worth repeatingfirst our work has very real human impactwhile jpmorganchase stock is owned by large institutions pension plans mutual funds and directly by single investors in almost all cases the ultimate beneficiaries are individuals in our com munitiesmore than  million people in the united states own stock many in one way or another own jpmorganchase stockfrequently these shareholders are veterans teachers police officers fire fighters healthcare workers retirees or those saving for a home education or retirementoften our employees also bank these shareholders as well as their families and their companiesyour man agement team goes to work every day recognizing the enormous responsibility that we have to all of our shareholderssecond shareholder value can be built only if you maintain a healthy and vibrant company which means doing a good job of taking care of your customers employ ees and communitiesconversely how can you have a healthy company if you neglect any of these stakeholders as we have learned over the past few years there are myriad ways an institution can demonstrate its compassion for its employees and its communities while still upholding shareholder value this letterwe recognize our strengths and vulnerabilities and we play our hand as best we cansixth we operate with a very important silent partner — the us government — noting as my friend warren buffett points out that his company’s success is predi cated upon the extraordinary conditions our country createshe is right to say to his shareholders that when they see the american flag they all should say thank youwe should toojpmorganchase is a healthy and thriving company and we always want to give back and pay our fair sharewe do pay our fair share — and we want it to be spent well and have the greatest impactto give you an idea of where our taxes and fees go in the last  years we paid more than  billion in federal state and local taxes in the united states and almost  billion in taxes out side of the united stateswe also paid the federal deposit insurance corporation over  billion so that it has the resources to cover failure in the american banking sectorour partner — the federal govern ment — also imposes significant regula tions upon us and it is imperative that we meet all legal and regulatory requirements imposed on our companyseventh and finally we know the founda tion of our success rests with our peoplethey are the frontline both individually and as teams serving our customers and communities building the technology making the strategic decisions managing the risks determining our investments and driving innovationhowever you view the world — its complexity risks and opportunities — a company’s prosperity requires a great team of people with guts brains integrity enormous capabilities and high standards of professional excel lence to ensure its ongoing successthird while we don’t run the company worrying about the stock price in the short run in the long run we consider our stock price a measure of our prog ress over timethis progress is a func tion of continual investments in our people systems and products in good and bad times to build our capabilitiesthese important investments will also drive our company’s future prospects and position it to grow and prosper for decadesmeasured by stock perfor mance our progress is exceptionalfor example whether looking back  years or even farther to  when the jpmorganchasebank one merger took place we have significantly out performed the standard  poor’s  index and the standard  poor’s finan cials indexfourth we are united behind basic prin ciples and strategies you can see the how we do business principles on our website that have helped build this company and made it thrive — from maintaining a fortress balance sheet constantly investing and nurturing tal ent to fully satisfying regulators contin ually improving risk governance and controls and serving customers and clients while lifting up communities worldwidethis philosophy is embedded in our company culture and influences nearly every role in the firmfifth we strive to build enduring busi nesses which rely on and benefit from one another but we are not a conglomer atethis structure helps generate our superior returnsnonetheless despite our best efforts the walls that protect this company are not particularly high — and we face extraordinary competitioni have written about this reality exten sively in the past and cover it again in  an important note to describe why we are showing the table above the loan loss reserve accounting rules — which are lifeofloan estimated losses based upon probabilitybased economic scenarios — generate huge swings in earnings that can be unrelated to actual credit performancethis was particularly true for the covid years when during the first six months of the pandemic we built approximately  billion in reservesthen in the next six quarters we released essentially the equivalent numberwe did so only because the scenarios used to estimate future credit losses changed

processbanking turmoil and regulatory goals the recent failures of silicon valley bank svb in the united states and credit suisse in europe and the related stress in the banking system under score that simply satisfying regulatory require ments is not sufficientrisks are abundant and managing those risks requires constant and vigi lant scrutiny as the world evolvesregarding the current disruption in the us banking system most of the risks were hiding in plain sightinterest rate exposure the fair value of heldtomaturity htm portfolios and the amount of svb’s uninsured deposits were always known — both to regulators and the marketplacethe unknown risk was that svb’s over  corporate clients — and activity within them — were controlled by a small number of venture capital companies that moved their deposits in lockstepit is unlikely that any recent change in regulatory requirements would have made a difference in what followedinstead the recent rapid rise of interest rates placed heightened focus on the potential for rapid deterioration of the fair value of htm portfolios and in this case the lack of sticki ness of certain uninsured depositsironically banks were incented to own very safe government securities because they were considered highly liq uid by regulators and carried very low capital requirementseven worse the stress testing based on the scenario devised by the federal reserve board the fed never incorporated interest rates at higher levelsthis is not to absolve bank man agement — it’s just to make clear that this wasn’t the finest hour for many playersall of these col liding factors became critically important when the marketplace rating agencies and depositors focused on them  update on specific issues facing our company as i write this letter the current crisis is not yet over and even when it is behind us there will be repercussions from it for years to comebut importantly recent events are nothing like what occurred during the  global financial crisis which barely affected regional banksin  the trigger was a growing recognition that  trillion of consumer mortgages were about to go bad — and they were owned by various types of entities around the worldat that time there was enor mous leverage virtually everywhere in the finan cial systemmajor investment banks fannie mae and freddie mac nearly all savings and loan insti tutions offbalance sheet vehicles aig and banks around the world — all of them failedthis current banking crisis involves far fewer financial players and fewer issues that need to be resolvedthese failures were not good for banks of any sizeany crisis that damages americans’ trust in their banks damages all banks — a fact that was known even before this crisiswhile it is true that this bank crisis “benefited” larger banks due to the inflow of deposits they received from smaller insti tutions the notion that this meltdown was good for them in any way is absurdlet’s be very thoughtful in our reaction to recent eventswhile this crisis will pass lessons will be learned which will result in some changes to the regulatory systemhowever it is extremely important that we avoid kneejerk whackamole or politically moti vated responses that often result in achieving the opposite of what people intendednow is the time to deeply think through and coordinate complex regulations to accomplish the goals we want eliminating costly inefficiencies and contradictory policiesvery often rules are put in place in one part of the framework without appreciating their consequences in combination with other regula tionsamerica has had and continues to have the best and most dynamic financial system in the world — from various types of investors to its banks rule of law investor protections transpar ency exchanges and other featureswe do not want to throw the baby out with the bath waterwe should have common goals on how we want the banking system to work • we want to strengthen regional midsized and community banks which are essential to the american economic systemthey fill a critical role in small communities offering local knowl edge and local relationships that some large banks simply can’t provide — or can’t provide costeffectivelyoverall we want to maintain the extraordinary strength this tiered system affordsjpmorganchase directly supports this goal as we are one of the largest bankers in america to regional and community bankswe bank approximately  of america’s  banks across the countrythis means we make loans to them or raise capital for themin addi tion we process payments for them finance some of their mortgage activities advise them on acquisitions provide them with interest rate swaps and foreign exchange and buy and sell securities for themand we also finance their local communities think hospitals schools and larger companies in ways they cannot • we need large complex banks to continue to play a critical role in the us and global financial systemand we need to recognize that they do so in a way regional banks can’tlarge banks are complex not because they want to be but because they operate in complex global marketsregional banks simply cannot manage the scale and complexity of transactions in  or  countries around the world to help some of america’s best and largest companies accom plish their goalsthink of equity debt ma research swaps foreign exchange large pay ments systems global custody and so onit takes a global workforce with deep expertise and significant capabilities to provide these ser vicesthese large global banks finance not just the world’s largest companies but the world’s development institutions and even countrieshaving some of the best large complex banks in the world is essential to the success of america’s biggest companies its economic system and its global competitiveness which says nothing against the importance of having great midsized and community banks as welland contrary to  update on specific issues facing our company what some say — to be safe a global bank needs both huge economies of scale and the strength of diversified earnings streams • we should want a system in which a bank failure does not cause undue panic and finan cial harmwhile you don’t want banks to fail all the time it should be allowed to happen and the resolution should follow a completely prescribed processin almost all bank failures uninsured deposits never resulted in lost money — but the very fear of loss can cause a run on any bank having characteristics similar to a bank that has failedresolution and recovery regulations did not work particularly well during the recent crisis — we should bring clarity and reassurance to both the unwinding process and measures to reduce the risk of additional bank runsit should also be noted that banks pay for any bank failure through fees paid to the federal deposit insur ance corporation as they pay for the whole financial regulatory systemand yes while these costs are ultimately passed on to their customers — that is true for all industries — the cost is just the price of implementing proper regulations • we want proper transparency and strong regu lationshowever it should be noted that regula tions the supervisory regime and the resolution regime currently in place did not stop svb and signature bank from failing — and from causing systemwide issueswe should not aim for a reg ulatory regime that eliminates all failure but one that reduces the chance of failure and the odds of contagionwe should carefully study why this particular situation happened but not overreactstrong regulations should not only minimize bank failures but also help to maintain the strength of banks as both the guardians of the financial system and engines that finance the great american economic machine • we should want market makers to have the ability to effectively intermediate particularly in difficult markets with central banks only step ping in during exceptional situationsin the last few years we have had many situations in which disruptions in the market were in my opinion largely caused by certain regulations that did not improve the safety of the market maker but instead damaged the safety of the whole sys temin addition many of the new “shadow bank” market makers are fairweather friends — they do not step in to help clients in tough times • we need banks to be there for their clients in tough timesand they have beenbanks can flex their capital and provide their clients with a lot of loans and liquidity when they really need itfor example at the beginning of the covid crisis in march  banks deployed over  billion in liquidity for clients and  billion in ppp loans — and this does not include banks’ share of the nearly  trillion in loans that entered forbearancebanks also play a unique and fundamental role in the transmission of monetary policy because deposits in banks can be loaned out effectively “creating” moneysome regulations and some accounting rules have become too procyclical and make it harder to do this • regulation particularly stress testing should be more thoughtful and forward lookingit has become an enormous mindnumbingly complex task about crossing t’s and dotting i’sfor exam ple the fed’s stress test focuses on only one sce nario which is unlikely to happenin fact this may lull risk committee members at any institu tion into a false sense of security that the risks they are taking are properly vetted and can be easily handleda less academic more collabora tive reflection of possible risks that a bank faces would better inform institutions and their regula tors about the full landscape of potential risks • we should decide a priori what should stay in the regulatory system and what shouldn’tthere are reasons for certain choices and they should not be the accidental outcome of uncoor dinated decision makingregulatory arbitrage is already forcing many activities from certain types of lending to certain types of trading out side the banking systemamong many questions that need definitive answers a few big ones would be do you want the mortgage business credit and market making along with other essential financial services inside the banking  update on specific issues facing our company system or outside of it what would be the longterm effect of that choice under the new scheme would nonbank creditproviding institu tions be able to provide credit when their clients need them the most i personally doubt that many of them could • we need banks to be attractive investmentsit is in the interest of the financial system that banks not become “uninvestable” because of uncertainty around regulations that affect capi tal profitability and longterm investingerratic stress test capital requirements and constant uncertainty around future regulations damage the banking system without making it saferwhile it is perfectly reasonable that a bank refrain from stock buybacks dividends or growth under certain circumstances it would be far better for the entire banking system if these rules were clearly enumerated ie stipulate that a bank needs to reduce its buybacks and dividend if they breach certain thresholdsif done properly banking regulations could be cali brated — adding virtually no additional risk — to make it easier for banks to make loans intermedi ate markets finance the economy manage a run on their bank and fail if need bewhen it comes to political debate about banking regulations there is little truth to the notion that regulations have been “loosened” at least in the context of large banks to the contrary our capital requirements have been increasing for years as shown on the chart on page  the debate should not always be about more or less regulation but about what mix of regulations will keep america’s banking system the best in the world such as capital and leverage ratios liquidity and what counts as liquidity reso lution rules deposit insurance securitization stress testing proper usage of the discount win dow tailoring and other requirements including potential requirements on shadow banksbecause of the recent problems we can add to this mix the review of concentrated customers uninsured deposits and potential limitations on the use of htm portfoliosideally new rules and regulations would also make it easier for banks to provide credit in tougher timesadjusting our strategy to the new regulatory reality basel iii endgame the basel iii endgame called basel iv by some — which incredibly has been nearly  years in the making — seems likely to increase yet again capi tal requirements for banks in general through higher operational risk changes and for trading and capital markets activity in particular among other thingswhether or not we agree with all these changes and we’ve discussed these regula tions in detail in prior letters we will simply have to adjust to them immediatelyit’s important we describe to our shareholders how we will go about doing that and what it means for banks and in particular our bankfirst and foremost banks must satisfy all of their regulatorswe must satisfy all of our regulators and remem ber we have regulators all around the world including more than  in the united states aloneregulations include stress testing reporting com pliance legal obligations and trading surveillance among otherswhile the business is the first line of defense on all these issues we also have  people in compliance  in risk and  lawyers actively working every day to meet the letter and the spirit of these rules along with the final line of defense — auditrules are constantly changing andor being enhanced and are sometimes unfortunately driven by political motivationsrelationships with regulators can often be intense and recently we have lost some terrific people in our firm because of thisregulators know that when banks disagree we essentially have no choice — there is no one to appeal to and even the act of appealing can make them angrywe simply ask respectfully to be heard but at the end of the day we will do what they ask us to do  update on specific issues facing our company banks will play a smaller role in the global financial systemthe chart above shows both the decreasing role and size of us banks relative to the global econ omy alongside the increasing role and size of shadow banksthe data illustrates this dynamicwe expect this trend to continue for all the reasons i’ve discussedbanks will continue to be guardians of the financial systemproperly regulated banks are meant to protect and enhance the financial systemthey are transpar ent with regulators and they strive mightily to protect the system from terrorism financing and tax evasion as they implement know your cus tomer guidelines and antimoney laundering lawsthey protect clients’ assets and clients’ money in movementbanks also help customers — from protecting their data and minimizing fraud and cyber risk to providing financial education — and must abide by social requirements such as the community reinvestment act which requires banks to extend their services into lowerincome communitiesas mentioned previously unlike the private market banks do not always choose when to provide a product or service but need to be there for their clients when they need credit or liquidity the mostlooking forward we constantly modify our strategies to adjust to our market realitiesit’s always best to adjust to new reality quicklywe really don’t

environmentsfirst and foremost we must conclude that hold ing certain types of credit loans or otherwise has generally become less profitable because of the high levels of capital that need to be held against it — generally more than the market demandswhat this means is that some credit is better held in a nonbankincreasingly for a credit relationship to make sense banks need a lot of noncreditrelated revenuebecause of various capital requirements we try to reduce clients’ nonoperating cash depositswe are seeking to implement much tighter man agement and execution of business strategiesthis includes repricing certain businesses run ning off certain unprofitable products changing the mix of business for a client and more rigor ously evaluating client selection and resource optimization applied to clientswe are exploring new capital optimization strategies which could include partnerships and perhaps one day more securitizations among other opportunitiesunfortunately it is becoming increasingly diffi cult for banks to stay in the mortgage business which ultimately hurts everyday americansthe high costs of origination and servicing along with the complexity of regulations create a costly business with significant legal reputational and operational challengesin addition given capital requirements and the lack of a healthy securiti zation market it barely makes sense for banks to hold mortgages or mortgageservicing rightsmany banks have already reduced much of this businesswe are hanging on continuing to hope for meaningful changewe have the ability to add lowcapital or nocapital revenue streams like providing valu able data and analytics in trading travel and other relevant offers in the consumer bank wealth management and payment services businesses among othersif you review our ceo letters you will see that we have many growth opportunities in front of us and our plans to attack themwe face the future and the new competition large and small with confi dence strength and a dash of humilitykeeping an eye on all of our competitors the growing competition to banks from each other as well as shadow banks fintechs and large tech nology companies is intense and clearly contribut ing to the diminishing role of banks and public companies in the united states and the global financial systemthe pace of change and the size of the competition are extraordinary and activity is acceleratingwalmart for example with over  million instore customers each week can use new digital technologies to efficiently bring bankingtype services to their customersapple already a strong presence in bankingtype services with apple pay and the apple card is actively moving into other similar services such as payment processing credit risk assessment personto person payment systems merchant acquiring and buynowpaylater offerslarge tech companies already  digital have hundreds of millions of customers as well as enormous resources in data and proprietary systems — all of which give them an extraordinary competitive advantagewe remain confident that as long as we stay vigilant hungry adaptable fast and disciplined we will continue to succeed in building this great company  update on specific issues facing our company as recent countries and companies have demon strated great management and leadership are critical to any large organization’s longterm successwhile providing strong management is a disciplined and rigorous process — facts analysis detail rinse and repeat — creating an exceptional management team is an art not a sciencein the rest of this section i talk about some management lessons — i always enjoy sharing what i have learned over time by watching others and through my own successes and failuresbuilding true franchise value accounting can distort actual economic realityi have spoken in the past about good and bad reve nue and good and bad expensescertain expenses such as opening welldesigned and welllocated branches actually are longterm investments of great valueconversely poorly underwritten credit creates revenue that you are bound to regretfurther there are accounting practices that may distort the true value of actions you takefor example when we create a new credit card account we recognize origination costs over  months but an average account exists for over eight yearsand with the new accounting rules for loan loss reserves — called the current expected credit losses standard — you book the expected life of loan losses on the day you make the loan while the revenue comes in over multiple yearsincreasingly in the modern world many valuable things are not reflected on our balance sheet in generally accepted accounting principles — for example previously expensed intellectual prop erty or extraordinary human capitalat the end of the day human capital is the most valuable assetthink of a great athlete a great lawyer or a great artistit’s not simply the equipment — it’s the extraordinary training and talent of those involved as we’ve also seen with the us militaryand sometimes it’s not the individual but the highly coordinated activities of the team that deliver the championshipfinally if any value is based upon models one must really test the sensitivity of the outcome against changes in assumptionsunderstanding the range of potential outcomes may be far more important than the point estimate created by a modelin some cases you can have an excellent average outcome but with a chance of deaththe point is accounting can distort economic real ity and can lead one to make the wrong decisionsbuilding true franchise value requires an outcomesbased outlookin banking specific examples illustrate how merely following accounting and capital rules — without thinking through the outcomes— can lead one astrayi’m going to describe just two examples but there are hundreds moreif you buy or create a loan at par and put it on your balance sheet at par think of a mortgage and internally finance it even matchfunded with  capital you might believe you have a  returnmany companies subscribe to this interpretation and simply continue to borrow money to invest in such a thingbut i would tell you this product has management lessons  management lessons no franchise value because it is only worth par and in fact a small change in that value because of interest rates and credit spread could mean that you have made a huge mistakeif on the other hand you create a loan and sell it at more than par at a profit you have created value — whether or not you keep it on your balance sheetand far more important if you create a loan and at the same time forge a client relationship — and you add additional capitallight revenue such as asset management and cash management — you have created something of longterm value that you can nurture and growthis is franchise valuesimply taking interest rate risk which contributed to the downfall of svb is not a businessnor is simply taking credit riskone person and a com puter will suffice — you do not need  people circling the globe to do thatanother example relates to any branchbased businesslet’s say i build a system with well designed and welllocated branches staffed by welltrained personnel who can offer customers great products and services and who strive to do every task a little bit betterthen you build a branch system with outdated sites in poor loca tions often to save money that have undertrained and underpaid staff and lowerquality products and servicesbetween the two my branch system will win every timeone system will have high franchise value and be selfperpetuating with high returnsthe other enterprise is probably on the road to eventual failureif you study the history of business you can see this phenomenon play out in grocery stores car companies restaurants retailers and various other enterpriseslearning from investor day in february  we did not hold our annual inves tor day for the obvious reason — covidwhen february  came around we were somewhat happy to be relieved of that responsibility againinvestor day is a tremendous amount of workbut from  to  we did a lot of investment spending and made several acquisitionssome of our analysts questioned whether we were being transparent enough in terms of what we were doing and why we were doing itwhile sometimes we get frustrated with investor demands — and not all investors are created equally — all investors should be treated fairly and with respectso in  we gave it more thought and reversed course with an extensive investor dayour senior management team explained in detail our acquisitions and our investments answering every question to the best of their abilityhaving to explain your business to investors comparing yourself with competitors and looking at the business as a whole — across sales marketing returns growth risks and strategic opportunities — was a terrific exercise for uswe learned our lesson this also raises another issueof course it is criti cally important to analyze your business at the right disaggregated level — right down to the branch — inside the companybut it is also import ant to have the proper segments reported exter nally to the company properly accounted for and generally aligned to their relevant competitorsthis actually helps hold managers accountable by forcing them to accurately assess performance — the good the bad and the ugly — without any attempts to avoid reality through an external obfuscation of results  management lessons balancing a customercentric approach with excessive risk most businesses including banks like us say they put their customers firstwe often go further than that statement to say that we need to be there for them in good times and in badhowever banking is a complex industry and this customercentric approach requires a little more explanationin our business we are essentially a financial partner to a clientwhile we strive to build great client relationships based on trust over the long run our role has intricaciesfor example we do not need every transaction to make economic sense — just the overall client relationship year after yearwhatever the transaction we need to be properly compensated for the risks we bear which can be extraordinaryvery often a client will merely look for the lowest price which we completely understand we recognize that some times banks are perfectly willing to make a cer tain transaction for a client at a lossthere are also occasions when we need to tell a client that a specific financial transaction would be imprudent — maybe for us and the clientsay for example that a very strong client of ours is simply trying to get the best price for a lever aged loanif we believe the desired price is unwise and another institution is willing to offer it we will advise the client to take that optionfor us this is pure counterparty risk and not really part of our core relationshipconversely should the same client come to us and request something that extends beyond what we consider reasonable for that transaction we may nonetheless do itperhaps the client is in the middle of an ma transaction in difficult markets and simply cannot get the financing they need — other than from usin recent crises we have often gone the extra mile for a client at great risks to ourselves not to make a profit but to rescue the client from financial calamityfundamentally putting the client first means always providing them with the products and ser vices they need although they may go somewhere else because of price and having our whole team work hard for them — either in the united states or around the world reliably and with constancyone of the most important things we do for a client above all else is to be a steady hand providing financial safety and security at every turn  management lessons some commonsense principles for corporate governance i have written before about the diminishing role of public companies in the american financial systemthey peaked in  at  and now totalconversely the number of private us companies backed by private equity firms has grown from  to  over the last two decadesand this does not include the increasing number of compa nies owned by sovereign wealth funds and family officesthis migration is serious and worthy of critical study and it may very well increase with more regulation and litigation comingwe really need to consider is this the outcome we want there are good reasons for such healthy private markets and some good outcomes have resulted from them as wellthe reasons are complex and may include public market factors such as onerous reporting requirements higher litigation expenses costly regulations cookiecutter board governance less compensation flexibility height ened public scrutiny and the relentless pressure of quarterly earningswith intensified public reporting investors’ grow ing needs for environmental social and gover nance information and the universal proxy — which makes it very easy to put disruptive directors on a board — the pressure to become a private com pany will risecorporate governance principles are becoming more and more templated and formu laic which is a negative trendfor example some times proxy advisors automatically judge board members unfavorably if they have been on the board a long time without a fair assessment of their actual contributions or experienceand some simple sensible governance principles are far bet ter than the formulaic onesthe governance of major corporations is evolving into a bureaucratic compliance exercise instead of focusing on its rela tionship to longterm economic valuegood corpo rate governance is critical and a little common sense would go a long waypromoting open communication and trust with the board as authorized and coordinated by the board direc tors should have unfettered access to manage ment including those below the ceo’s direct reportsat every board meeting to ensure open and free discussion the full board should meet in executive session without the ceo or other mem bers of managementthe independent directors should ensure that they have enough time to do this properlythis one act would allow the board to have a com pletely open conversation and provide candid feedback to the ceo and management teamgood ceos who are trying to do the best job they can should appreciate this important feedback — and should know how difficult it is to gather in a large groupthis type of quality discussion among and with board members leads to collaboration and good succession planning since every meeting should include a real conversation around this important topicmeetings such as these allow the board to nurture the extraordinary value of collaboration and trustconfronting succession planning our board is responsible for succession planning and it is on the agenda every time board members meet — both when they are with me and when i am not in the roomwe already have a “hitbythe truck” plan ready to go not all companies can say this and we have multiple successor candidates who are wellknown to the board and to the inves tor communitythe board believes this is one of its paramount prioritiesyou can rest assured that our board members are on the case and are very comfortable with where we are  some commonsense principles for corporate governance active engagement with asset managers we — companies and investors — need to become more active and involved in proxy issues each year to foster better communication between the investors and the board of the companies they ownwhether it’s issues around climate risk or say on pay it should be appropriate for the man agement team or board to actively engage with investors during proxy season to hear and under stand each other’s views on key issues and com municate their positions in real timeinvestors should also require proxy advisors to share any communications they have with a company in real time before investors make voting decisionsin my view too many portfolio managers and inves tors have partially ceded critical decisions on key proxy issues to their internal stewardship groups or external proxy advisorsstewardship teams are also often under pressure to follow proxy advisors by bureaucratic internal systems at investment firms that discourage disagreement and encourage the safety of the herdmany port folio managers have told me that even when they have the authority to override the internal group it is frequently very difficult to do sothe new universal proxy is likely to create havoc for companiesthe new universal proxy makes it such that one investor with one share who owns it for as little as one day can nominate a director for any rea son at relatively low costin my view it is likely that not just activists but also special interest groups will nominate directorsnot only would this be extremely disruptive to the board but almost by their nature special interest groups would be counter to shareholders’ interestswhile we fully respect being transparent — protecting investors and shareholder rights — director elec tion processes are becoming too far removed from shareholder interestswhile there are legitimate complaints against entrenched boards good boards often tend to interview prospective candidates for their brains integrity work ethic management and collabora tion skills and experiencewith this new universal proxy it’s easy to envision a time when a proxy season will be like a political campaign with inter est groups on both sides of an issue trying to elect a board memberdisruptive boards which can be caused by just a single troublesome member are an anathema to shareholders’ intereststhis is unlikely to end well  some commonsense principles for corporate governance we usually don’t worry about typical economic fluctuations and often compare economic forecast ing with weather forecasting it is extremely com plicated easy to do in the short term and far more difficult to do in the long runit is particularly hard to forecast true longerterm inflection points in the economyalthough we don’t want to waste time on “normal” fluctuations we do want to be prepared for economic extremes — we look at multiple pos sibilities and probabilities and manage our com pany so that we can handle all of them whether or not we think they actually will happenafter we spoke last year about storm clouds some of those storms did indeed hit and unfortunately some of those threatening clouds are still here  was not normal economically speaking and in fact  witnessed several dramatic events — the ukraine war began inflation hit a year high of  the federal funds rate experienced one of its most rapid increases up  basis points albeit from a low level stock markets were down  unemployment fell to a year low at  and the us economy was bolstered by frequent fiscal stimulus and by high and rising government debt while supply chain issues easedin addition work from home began to raise commercial real estate challenges and finally long and short term interest rates presented a sharply inverted yield curve which is “eight for eight” in terms of predicting a recession more on this laterbut surprisingly the global economy marched aheadthe current economy pretty good but storm clouds ahead until the collapse of silicon valley bank the cur rent economy was performing adequately both here in the united states and remarkably better than anyone expected in europethe “market” was generally forecasting either a soft landing or a mild recession with interest rates peaking at  and then slowly coming downthere has been a lot of market volatility over the past year partially in my opinion as people overextrapolate monthly data which is highly dis torted by inflation supply chain adjustments con sumer substitution basically poor assumptions about housing costs and other factorsbut under lying all this consumers have been spending  to  more than in the prior year and  more than precovidsimilarly their balance sheets are in great shape as they still have according to our own analysis  trillion more “excess cash” in their checking accounts than before the pan demic credit card debt is simply normalizingin addition unemployment is extremely low and wages are going up particularly at the low endwe’ve had  years of home and stock price appre ciation and even if we go into a recession con sumers would enter it in far better shape than during the great financial crisisfinally supply chains are recovering businesses are pretty healthy and credit losses are extremely lowthe failures of svb and credit suisse have signifi cantly changed the market’s expectations bond prices have recovered dramatically the stock mar ket is down and the market’s odds of a recession have increasedand while this is nothing like  it is not clear when this current crisis will endit has provoked lots of jitters in the market and will clearly cause some tightening of financial condi tions as banks and other lenders become more conservativehowever it is unclear whether this disruption is likely to slow consumer spending as of april   spending has been consistently running higher versus the prior yearalthough higher rates particularly in mortgages have reduced both home sales and prices do remember that consumer spending drives more than  of the us economyevaluating and managing the economic and geopolitical risks ahead  evaluating and managing the economic and geopolitical risks ahead while the current crisis has exposed some weak nesses in the system it should not be considered as i pointed out anything like what we experienced innonetheless we do have other unique and complicated issues in front of us which are outlined in the chart abovepotential trouble brewing from unprecedented fiscal spending quantitative tightening and geopolitical tensions having already confessed to how difficult it is to predict the future for planning purposes it still makes sense to try to assess the environment ahead by laying out those factors that may be significantly different from the pastfiscal stimulus is still surging through the systemin the last three years partially but not entirely due to the pandemic the federal government had a deficit of  trillion   trillion  and  trillionthese are extraordinary numbers which ended up in consumers’ pockets in states and local municipalities and even in com panieswe pointed out last year that you simply cannot have this level of spending and say that it’s not inflationaryit’s also important to point out that there is a multiplier effect of this stimulus that is one person’s spending is another person’s income and so onthe deficit for the next three years is now estimated to be  trillion to  trillion per year which is also an extraordinary number with no end in sightin europe fiscal defi cits are high — even before the enormous subsidies given to consumers to counterbalance higher energy pricesit’s also important to note that borrowing to invest is fundamentally different from borrowing to consume — borrowing to con sume can only be inflationarythis is before any additional costs related to future recessions the war or any other unforeseeable eventsoffsetting this by sometime late this year or early next year we expect consumers will have spent the bulk of their remaining excess savingsit remains to be seen whether this will cause a little bit of a cliff effect or whether consumer spending will simply slow downeither way this will add to whatever recessionary pressures there are some time in the futuretoday’s quantitative tightening is following more than a decade of quantitative easingin the two years after covid the fed bought  trillion of ustreasuries and mortgage backed securities bringing its total balance sheet to  trillionwe have experienced almost  years of quantitative easing qe which drove interest rates down — so much so that us short term rates were virtually zero and the year bond hit a low ofamazingly tens of trillions of dollars of debt mostly in europe sold at negative interest rates we will look back upon this with total astonishmentthis period of qe also led to extraordinary liquidity and a surging money here  now  in front of us storm clouds ahead still good economy abnormal qt  fiscal spending war energy crisis trade china healthy consumer healthy jobs higher wages good credit home values up over  years recovering supply chain normalized interest rates healthy business consumer excess savings close to zero by yearend large quantitative

inflationary trade adjustments economic alliances in flux potential for rising oil and gas prices huge economic and geopolitical strains  evaluating and managing the economic and geopolitical risks ahead supply that undoubtedly drove increased prices across many investment classes — from stocks and bonds to crypto meme stocks and real estate among othersimportantly this also increased bank deposits from  trillion to  trillion and the nowfamous uninsured deposits from  trillion to  trillionqe is now being reversed into quantitative tighten ing qt as the fed grapples with inflationso far the fed has reduced its securities holdings by approximately  billion and is committed to reducing its holdings by almost  billion in securities each month or over  trillion each yearhow all this will unfold is still unknown as the direction and speed of money have changed sig nificantly from prior yearsto varying degrees banks will compete for money not only among one another but also with money market funds other investments and the fed itselfmoney market fund total assets under management have increased by  billion since april  with a significant portion migrating into the fed’s reverse repo facil ity thereby draining deposits from the banking systemso while the fed’s balance sheet has come down by approximately  billion deposits at the banks have come down by  trillion largely uninsured depositsunfortunately some banks invested much of these excess deposits in “safe” treasuries which of course went down in value as rates rose faster than most people expectedit should be noted that an inordinate amount of attention is focused on shortterm interest rates which the fed affects directlybut the fed does not completely control longterm rates and liquid ity which are influenced by both supply and demand qt and global investor preferences and sentiment — importantly including views on risk and safetyit is also important to remember that while the central banks of the world are now sell ing instead of buying securities the governments of the world have larger debts to financethe united states alone needs to sell  trillion in securities which must be absorbed in the marketthis turn of events is generally true globallythere has been huge intervention by central banks around the world over the last decadewhile it was completely necessary in  and  to stop the worst of the global financial crisis and again in  to stop the effects of the global pandemic the depth and breadth of these interventions will be studied for years as will the extent to which we need qt whose full effect may not be known immediatelyit is unclear how the fed incorpo rated the enormous fiscal spending into both its forecasts for growth and inflation as well as its need to continue qe as it didand importantly the fed’s ability to reverse course on this strategy qt is somewhat constrained by higher inflation though of course it can temporarily adjust its actions to deal with the current bank failure crisiswar complicates geopolitics and materially adds riskswe have not had a major land war in europe sincethe war in ukraine already into its second year has been particularly devastating in terms of casualties and damage and has been haunted by the threat of nuclear weaponsit may very well last for many more yearswars are unpredictable and at the start most predictions about how they will end have been completely wrongthis war is also affecting global energy and food supplies with a disproportionate and negative effect falling on poor people and poorer nations including millions of ukrainian refugeesthere is still a risk that energy and food supply lines which are not secure will lead to higher prices and the large migration of people triggering another level of geopolitical dislocationthe tensions of this war are also leading to the rethinking of many economic alliances as well as trade and national securityall these factors create more risk and potentially higher inflation and their confluence along with inflation and qt creates a somewhat unpredictable and dangerous outcomethis may be a onceinageneration sea change with material effectof course there is always uncertaintyi am often frustrated when people talk about today’s uncer tainty as if it were any different from yesterday’s uncertaintyhowever in this case i believe it actually is  evaluating and managing the economic and geopolitical risks ahead less predictable geopolitics in general and a complex adjustment to relationships with china are probably leading to higher military spending and a realignment of global economic and military allianceshigher fiscal spending higher debt to gross domestic product gdp higher investment spend in general including climate spending higher energy costs and the inflationary effect of trade adjustments all lead me to believe that we may have gone from a savings glut to scarce capital and may be headed to higher inflation and higher interest rates than in the immediate pastessentially we may be moving as i read some where from a virtuous cycle to a vicious cyclepreparing for what may be a new and uncertain future of course we hope that everything turns out okay and that all of these storm clouds peacefully and painlessly dissipate – and we need to be prepared for that outcomewe also need to be prepared for a new and uncertain futurethe new risks in addition to the normal ones like recession are higher inflation for longer the market effects of qt and growing political risksof course i cannot be sure this will happen but i place higher odds on it than the “market” managing risks is far more than simply meeting the fed’s annual stress testwhile it is critical that we meet and pass the fed’s comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar stress test managing risk is far more than that – and we are fairly fanatical when it comes to manag ing riskour company does hundreds of stress tests a week which include market movements reflective of many past crises such as volatility resulting from the russiaukraine conflict and the pandemic in  and rapidly rising interest ratesthe fed’s ccar stress test by its nature has fairly arbitrary results since it uses only one different and hypothetical scenario each yearthis creates uncertainty around our capital requirements as i mentioned this may damage the value of bank stocks and the banking systemif i were a share holder i would want to know if my company would really lose the  billion after taxes over a ninequarter period that the stress test showsand the answer is absolutely notwhile i understand why regulators stress test this way — they are essentially trying to ensure that banks survive the worstcase scenario which assumes multiple problems at a struggling bank without any benefit from good management or rapid response — the methodology clearly does not result in an accurate forecast of how our com pany would perform under adverse circumstancesi have very little doubt that if the severely adverse scenario played out jpmorganchase would per form far better than the stress test projectionsi believe we would actually make money over the nine quarters in the fed’s stress scenariohere’s one example that illustrates thisfrom march  to march   when the stock market fell  and the bond index spread gapped from  to  basis points prior to major fed inter vention our actual trading revenue was higher than normal as we actively made markets for our clientsby contrast the hypothetical stress test had us losing a huge amount of money in market making based on the way it is calculatedone more thing to point out jpmorganchase now has enough total lossabsorbing capacity to bear out peak ccar losses using the fed’s numbers more than eight times overin addition to ccar testing we stress test for vari ous types of huge market disruptionsfor exam ple we stress counterparties — such as hedge funds large asset managers or trading houses — for extremely large market moves perhaps an instantaneous  basis point move in treasuries or  to  moves in commoditiesour share holders should know that regarding any major international bank we remain wellcollateralized across all of our exposureseven if one of those banks went bankrupt overnight we would be okaywhile there is always a risk that we won’t receive a margin call or that some trades may default and leave us exposed to large market risk the losses likely would not be materialsuffice it to say our company prepares not only for various forms of extreme economic risk but for various forms of geopolitical risklater in this letter i describe how we have enhanced those efforts  evaluating and managing the economic and geopolitical risks ahead don’t underestimate the extreme importance of interest ratesinterest rates are extraordinarily important — they are the cosmological constant or the mathemati cal certainty that affects all things economicbefore i comment on that i want to share some astounding numbers to illustrate this point when you analyze a stock you look at many factors earnings cash flow competition margins scenar ios consumer preferences new technologies and so onbut the math above is immovable and affects allin a rapidly rising rate environment any invest ment where the cash flows were expected in the out years would have been dramatically affected — think venture capital or real estate development for exampleany form of carry trade effectively borrowing short and investing long would be sorely disappointedcarry trade exists not just in banks but is embedded and is silently present in companies investment vehicles and others includ ing situations that require recurring refinancingwe are prepared for potentially higher interest rates and we may have higher inflation for longerif we have higher inflation for longer the fed may be forced to increase rates higher than people expect despite the recent bank crisisalso qt may have ongoing impacts that might over time be another force pushing longerterm rates higher than currently envisionedthis may occur even if we have a mild — or notsomild — recession as we saw in the s and stoday’s inverted yield curve implies that we are going into a recessionas someone once said an inverted yield curve like this is “eight for eight” in predicting a recession in the next  monthshowever it may not be true this time because of the enormous effect of qtas previously stated longerterm rates are not necessarily controlled by central banks and it is possible that the inver sion we see today is still driven by prior qe and not the dramatic change in supply and demand that is going to take place in the futurewe have always looked at the “fat tails” of higher interest rates particularly on our own companywe were premature in thinking about the possibil ity of interest rates going to   or  — which still might not happen but we always want to be protected against this outcomefor example we have spoken about stockpiling cash not investing in sovereign debt when rates were low and being willing to forgo income to protect against rising ratesrest assured our company can handle significantly higher interest rates no matter how anyone analyzes capitalhigher interest rates will obviously have an important impact not just for banks but for some of those who borrow on a floating rate or those who have to refinance in a higher rate environ mentif this tide goes out you should assume that it will expose additional weaknesses in the econ omyhowever our company is prepared — not only for higher rates but for a potential recession that could arise and related credit lossesthat prepara tion includes analyzing all of our clients in particu lar our leveraged lending real estate and other cli ents for what the impact of higher rates may mean for themwe believe the risks within our own portfolio are manageableand we try to ana lyze the impact of these factors on companies and industries away from usfor example we do expect that some types of real estate in certain locations may come under pressurefinally we assume all of these risks and uncertain ties will result in volatile marketsnet present value npv of  annuity lifetime npv  npv in first  years  interest rate    interest rate    evaluating and managing the economic and geopolitical risks ahead there are risks and opportunities in the restructuring of global economic relationsthere is no question that supply chains need to be restructured for three different reasons • for any products or materials that are essential for national security think rare earths g and semiconductors the us supply chain must be domestic or only open to completely friendly allies or partnerswe cannot and should not ever be reliant on processes that can and will be used against us especially when we are most vulnerableall countries will be protecting their national security in their own way tailoring their strategies as they see fit • countries will also be taking specific action to protect critical industries think electric vehicles ev ai and chips that may not be directly related to national security but are key to national competitivenessthis is essentially what america’s ira is meant to do • companies will diversify their supply chains simply to be more resilientthis restructuring will likely take place over time and does not need to be excessively disruptivethere will be winners and losers — some of the main beneficiaries will be brazil canada mexico and friendly southeast asian nationsfor similar national security reasons activities — including investment activities — that help create a national security risk eg sharing critical technol ogy with potential adversaries should be restrictedwhile focusing on the risks it’s also important not to forget the opportunitiesthe transition to a green economy will eventually require  trillion a year in capital expendituresthe ira chips act and bipartisan infrastructure law combined will create huge opportunities for companies investors and entrepreneurs across virtually every industry group in the united statesyou can rest assured that our company is organizing to help clients make the most of these opportunitiesalong with reconfiguring our supply chains we must create new trading systems with our alliesmy preference would be to rejoin the transpacific partnership — it is the best geostrategic trade arrangement possible with allied nationsyou can be certain that our company is closely monitoring and adjusting to the risks and opportunities cre ated by current eventsbelieve it or not inflation and interest rates are not the things that worry me the mosti’m most concerned about large geopolitical events cyber attacks nuclear proliferation large dysfunctional markets partially due to poorly calibrated regula tions eg the ukgilt and ustreasury markets and failure of other critical infrastructurewe have established a new security forumthe war in ukraine has exposed the severity com plexity and interconnectivity of threats such as physical security the loss of nonbank critical infra structure ie communication networks pandem ics insider threats trade relations political risk sanctions data privacy war and the impact of regulatory and governmental actionsall these factors affect our company as well as our clients and countries and their governmentsyou should know that we have formed a new security forum which meets periodically and enables manage ment to continually assess the impact of ongoing threats to our company our clients and countries around the globethese risks — which include mar ket risk credit risk cyber risk and operational risk among others — are also covered at the board level by our risk committeefinally when one talks about risk for too long it begins to cloud your judgmentlooking ahead the positives are hugehowever events play out it is likely that  years from now america’s gdp will be more than twice the size it is today and hundreds of millions of people around the world will have been lifted out of povertyin the next section i talk more about the need for a global economic strategy  evaluating and managing the economic and geopolitical risks ahead like most americans i get frustrated with the mediocrity and bureaucracy of the massive admin istrative statewe accept it too readilyand it dam ages the confidence we have in our own countryi have enormous respect for the people who work for the us government but we simply don’t invest enough in making it more effectivesome examples are antiquated systems at the federal aviation administration united states postal service and internal revenue service inefficient ports and crumbling infrastructure an ineffective immigra tion policy policies that prevent affordable housing and leave apartments vacant policies that hurt puerto rico tenure versus meritbased compensa tion and promotion and work rules that dramati cally reduce efficiencywe have a vast system with a lack of accountability and proper reportingand usually when reports are issued they only address how much money was spent — not for example how many highway miles were built in what time period and at what costgovernment which is  of the economy seems to be getting less produc tive over time unlike the rest of the economyin addition we have too much litigation — this is the bureaucratization of america — think europeto be completely fair i am also frustrated with the typically shortsighted selfishness of some busi nesses asking for abundant special tax breaks and often using regulations to protect the incumbenti also want to express exasperation with some of my fellow citizens who don’t pay the taxes they owe on the order of  billion a year who won’t con sider sensible policy measures like a carbon tax to stem climate change and who sometimes seem to only like democracy when the voters agree with themdemocracy by its nature is compromiseone of the lessons of the past decade is that if major legislation cannot be done in a bipartisan way maybe it should not be done at alldeveloping effective policy and effective government theology is not policypolicy based on falsehood or oversimplified facts is doomed to failuretoo often now policy starts as politics without the benefit of analytics and expertspolicy should precede politics — not the other way aroundpolicy should be painstakingly developed based on facts and analysis and on information about how policies were productively developed in other parts of the worldyou can effectively crowd source policy expertisewhy were germany and switzerland so successful with apprenticeship pro grams why were canada and singapore so effec tive with permitting and infrastructure all poli cies like education infrastructure and regulation need to start with an agreedupon goal — and be comprehensive and coordinated to accomplish itafter the core of a policy is developed then of course it will be modified by political leaders — but it is hoped the core of the policy remains intactif those modifications bastardize it in such a way as to render it inefficient it should be droppedwe require a st century governmentin a company you are constantly setting up your organization for successwe need to find a way to more rapidly reorganize our government for the new worldwhile congress can often move very quickly in a crisis we are unable to move quickly as a government over the medium termwe need to move faster adopt new technologies and retrain human capital more quicklyeven in a good company reorganizing for change can be hard — business and staff units fight to maintain their status quo and perceived prerogatives as if their lives were at stakei can only imagine how hard this is in the government but it will only get worse if we do not fix this in our fastchanging worldour serious need for more effective public policy and competent government  our serious need for more effective public policy and competent government by jamie dimon r ussia’s invasion of ukraine punc tured many assumptions about the future of the world and thus was a pivotal moment in historyamerica and the west can no longer maintain a false sense of security based on the illusion that dicta torships and oppressive nations won’t use their economic and military powers to advance their aims—particularly against what they perceive as weak incompetent and disorganized western democraciesin a troubled world we are reminded that national security is and always will be paramount even if it seems to recede in tranquil timesit should also lay to rest the idea that america can stand aloneus leaders must always put america first but global peace and order is a vital american interestonly america has the full capability to lead and coalesce the western world though we must do so respectfully and in partnership with our allieswithout cohesiveness and unity with our allies autocratic forces will divide and conquer the bickering westamerica needs to lead with its strengths— not only military but also economic diplo matic and moralhere’s what we can do • rededicate ourselves to the qualities and principles that made america greatthese principles are life liberty the pursuit of happiness and the idea that all people are created equaldemocracy and human freedom are inseparable from freedom of speech freedom of religion and free enter priseit would help to educate all americans about the sacrifice of those who came before us for democracy at home and abroadwe need to acknowledge the critical role that government plays—and we need government to be more competent and accountablewe must build stronger safety nets to care for the poor the old and the disabled and to cushion adjustment to economic change while also maintaining economic dynamism individual responsi bility and the dignity of workwe must confront crises and failures of public policy by developing better policies and by dealing with realitieswe can recognize the mistakes america has made without disparaging the nationwe support global human rights and stand on the side of liberty but we also have to be realistic about the compromises necessary to accomplish longterm goalsremember franklin droosevelt and winston churchill allied with stalin against hitler’s imminent threat • develop a marshall plan for global energy and food securitythis will be critical both in keeping the western alliances together and minimizing the global suffering caused by starvationglobal energy and food supply chains are precarious by their natureand it should be selfevident that energy security and preventing climate change aren’t contra dictory secure and reliable oil and gas production is compatible with reducing co over the long run and is far better than burning more coalit should also be selfevident that global food and energy security relies on realistic trade policy and american military strength • increase military spending along with our allies as much as necessary to protect the worldnot only is america a bastion of freedom it is still the arsenal of democracy and economic sanctions are no substitute for an effective military “we know only too well that war comes not when the forces of freedom are strong but when they are weak” as ronald reagan said inmilitary strength needs to be combined and coordinated with strong diplomatic and economic aid for the devel oping worldthoughtful policies would help many nations lift up their people develop their human rights and join eco nomic unions that are good for all involved • recover our economic dynamisma strong economy is the foundation for american power and we haven’t focused enough on economic growthbetween  and  real usgdp grew at an average rate of only  a yearhad we grown at  instead last year’s gross domestic product per person would have been  higherthat would help pay for much of what we need to do as a nationeconomic growth will repair the fraying of the american dream particularly if we share the wealth by improving education and wages for lowerpaid citizensthere are many effective ways to do this such as raising minimum wages and expanding the earnedincome tax creditwe must also fix the immigration policies that are tearing us apart dramatically reducing illegal immi gration and dramatically increasing legal immigrationeconomic growth will reduce inflation reduce the deficit and make it easier to afford the strong military we needwe aren’t going to have the economic growth we need with the legal regulatory and bureaucratic system we have todayglobal trade will necessarily be restruc tured so that we don’t rely on potential adversaries for critical goods and servicesthis will require more “industrial plan ning” than america is used to—and we must ensure it is properly done and is not used for political purposesyet america should also open its arms through trade and aid to all other nationsmost develop ing countries would prefer to align eco nomically with the west if we help them solve their problemswe should develop a new strategic and economic framework to make ourselves their partner of choice • deal with china thoughtfully and without fearamerica still has an enor mously strong hand—plenty of food water and energy peaceful neighbors and what is still the most prosperous and dynamic economy the world has ever seen with a per person gdp of over  a yearwe can have faith that our system will maintain the economic dynamism we needchina has done a great job lifting up its nation and bringing its gdp per person up to  a yearyet any fair assessment must recognize its challenges—not enough food water and energy a very complex geopolitical situation with tough neighbors a lack of freedom that creates economic rigidity and malinvestmentwhether you think it is a competitor or a potential adversary we along with our allies should firmly negotiate with china where my company and its predecessor firms have done business for more than a centurywe should acknowledge that we have common interests in combating nuclear proliferation climate change and terrorismtough but thoughtful negotia tions over strategic military and economic concerns—including unfair competition— should yield a better situation for allif america leads well china will be better off forming partnerships with a strong western world than with russia iran and other such nationstogether we can ensure america’s lead ership for the next  yearsmrdimon is chairman and ceo of jpmorganchase  cothe west needs america’s leadership how the us can marshal its strengths—not only military but also moral economic and diplomatic originally published in the wall street journal on januaryreprinted with permissioncreating a comprehensive global economic strategy just as we need a comprehensive military strategy globally to deal with future security risks we need a comprehensive global economic strategy to deal with future economic risksdone properly this will help strengthen and coalesce the western demo cratic alliances over an extended period of timethis strategy has four pillarsfirst we need a us growth strategybetween  and  real usgdp grew at an average rate of only  a yearhad we grown at  instead last year’s gdp per person would have been  higherthat would help pay for much of what we need to do as a nationwe simply have not focused enough on growing the us economyin prior letters we have spoken about how we need to get public policy right to address a multi tude of areas which span ineffective education systems soaring healthcare costs excessive regu lation and bureaucracy the inability to plan and build infrastructure efficiently inequitable taxes a capricious and wasteful litigation system frustrat ing immigration policies and reform inefficient mortgage markets and housing markets and hous ing policy a partially untrained and unprepared labor force excessive student debt and the lack of proper federal government budgeting and spend ingi believe that our poor policies have restrained our growth and simply improving those policies would accelerate our growthwe should also focus on reducing the worker shortages by allowing both more meritbased immigration and seasonal immigrationreducing trade barriers could also have a rapid effect and decreasing regulations and bureaucracy would be helpfulfor example starting a small business today generally requires multiple licenses which take precious months to getbut it doesn’t end theretalk with any small business owner and that person will describe the mountains of red tape inefficient systems and huge amount of documen tation involved to operate the businesswe need to reduce the burdens that are imposed on those who want to open and run a small businessby seeking a bold comprehensive approach we increase our ability to positively impact economic growth and jobs in fact this is also the best way to reduce inflation and the deficitsecond an industrial policy done properly could drive growth and also protect our national securitythe united states has essentially never had an “industrial policy” a strategy by which the federal government through incentives and policies drives american industrywe have done it indi rectly through things like the defense advanced research projects agency and nasa’s moon mis sion but not generally by favoring industriesmore directly the ira and the chips act provide specific incentives for evs semiconductors rare earths alternative energy sources and othersthere are two reasons we should develop an industrial policy  specifically to safeguard our national security and  to counter unfair economic competition particu larly where our national security is directly con cernedfor example making bicycles would not be part of the second examplebut china using subsi dies and its economic muscle to dominate batteries rare earths semiconductors or evs could eventu ally imperil national security by disrupting our access to these products and materialswe cannot cede these important resources and capabilities to another countrycrafting an industrial policy should be done properly and with a tightly restricted scopeif the policy is politically motivated it will be used to benefit vari ous political benefactors and eventually provoke extreme misallocation of capital and corruptionmanaging the economy is extremely complex and adam smith’s invisible hand still prevails — in a way we can never understandif the government starts to micromanage through an industrial policy it will not stop and much of the efficiencies meant to be created will not be realizedindustrial policy should come with twins — very strict limitations on political interference and related comprehensive policy around factors like permitting require ments which if not drastically improved will inhibit our ability to make investments and allow infra structure to be built  our serious need for more effective public policy and competent government third fixing income inequality will reignite the american dreamof all the policy errors we need to remedy in amer ica there are two that i believe will have a dramatic effect on growth and equality — and go a long way toward repairing the frayed american dreamthe first is providing graduating students and other individuals with work skills in fields such as advanced manufacturing cyber data science and technology healthcare and so on that will lead to better paying jobsthis would be good for growth and much that ails usand we know what to dohigh schools and community colleges should work with local businesses to create specific skills training programs internships and apprenticeships that prepare graduating students to be job ready — whether they go on to earn a credential to work or to attend collegewith  million job openings and  million unemployed workers in the united states workskills training has never been needed morebusinesses must be involved in this process and programs need to be offered locally because that is where the actual jobs arethe second step is related to the first get more income to lowerpaid workersthe gap between skilled and unskilled workers has been growing dramatically — so much so that unskilled labor has become less and less a “living wage” of the  million americans working today approximately  million are paid less than  per hourit is hard to live on  an hour particularly for fami lies even if two household members are workingbut all jobs should be treated with respectjobs and living wages bring dignity lead to more opportunity — in housing education childcare health and overall wellbeing — and also help rebuild communities as that income is used to improve how people livea major step would be to expand the earned income tax credit eitc which many democrats and republicans already agree upontoday the eitc supplements low to moderateincome working individuals and couples particularly with childrenfor example a single mother with two children earning  an hour approximately  a year could receive a tax credit of more than  at year’s endworkers without children receive a very small tax credit — this should be dramatically expanded too — and personally i would eliminate the child requirement altogetherlast year the eitc program cost the united states about  billion and  million individuals received the creditwe should convert the eitc to make it more like a negative income payroll tax paid monthlymany people who are eligible for this benefit do not get it often because they do not know about itproper reform of this program could increase benefits where deserved and reduce fraudulent and improper paymentsany tax credit income should not be offset by any other benefits these individuals already receivei have little doubt that this would do more than anything else to lift up lowerincome neighbor hoods as the money is spent on lifting up their familiesi also have little doubt that this would add to gdp — because most of this money would in fact be spentfourth america must take the lead on devising a comprehensive global economic strategyin an oped published by the wall street journal earlier this year i wrote “only america has the full capability to lead and coalesce the western world though we must do so respectfully and in partner ship with our allieswithout cohesiveness and unity with our allies autocratic forces will divide and conquer the bickering westamerica needs to lead with its strengths—not only military but also economic diplomatic and moral”  our serious need for more effective public policy and competent government getting military strategy right isn’t sufficientwe must keep the western alliances together and actively appeal to developing nationsa compre hensive economic strategy would tighten the bonds strengthen our alliances and importantly maximize our economic resourcesfurthermore it must encompass a global trade and investment strategy a holistic plan around energy security and food security and far more dynamic develop ment finance for emerging marketsdone prop erly the economic strength to emerge from such collaboration will preserve our alliances entice jamie dimon chairman and chief executive officer april   nations such as india into the fold guarantee the strength of the us military and preserve the mighty us dollar as the world’s reserve currencyfinally more active diplomacy and more dynamic communication around the principles that moti vate the western world are requiredthese princi ples are life liberty the pursuit of happiness and the idea that all people are created equaldemoc racy and human freedom are inseparable from freedom of speech freedom of religion and free enterprisewe should
